Local police engagement in a positve and proactive way.  Engaging parents is a great way.  When it comes to security and education, I hear a consistent theme, we've got some really smart people doing great in school, but I see us spending a lot of time talking about the kid who has depression issues instead of focusing on the general population.

Crosstrain to bring cultural awareness and minimize perceptions.- Staffing is an issue.  - Teachers need to be empowered, message to students that you're going to be held accountable not just for behavior, but for school as well and in life.  I personally believe if you pay the right people and they do their job.  - The education system itself, applied learning is not learning enough. We need to challenge the  model we have now with like STEM.  What's important in the education system teaching students or getting them ready for the world.  What good is all this testing?  It's a waste of their time.  - Funding and training.  Being able to confirm who is should and should not be in class and making it mandatory."

It would be great to partner with all the construction sites that are throwing stuff away. The schools could split resources. Could some of the construction companies come and show kids about building? Hands on learning experiences. Half of her kids' parents work in construction. More opportunities for kids to take dual enrollment and career opportunities. Lots of kids want experience with culinary, shop, etc. A wide variety of programs. From a computer science aspect, community involvement like donations for equipment, guest speakers. Work experience and internships.  So that long term, students would be able to see a path to live and work in their community. Partnerships with city leaders so that they have an awareness as new businesses are coming in, they can tell them that we have programs that would support it. Maybe turn early release into an internship opportunity. Businesses probably want to help, educators want the help, but there's a disconnect to both communicating. Opportunities that let kids experience a job see what kind of jobs they like and what they don't like. It would be good to partner with locally owned businesses like Ace to find things that benefit both the schools and the community. It would be great to have schools with a focus like magnet schools. Kids graduate with skills that help them pay for life post high school. Bringing the community closer together. Affordable housing for teachers"

It would be helpful for them to be communicating with computer science classes. They're trying to improve the quality of theater shows, but budget for supplies is difficult. Technological savvy and tools. Changing job interviews that have a hands-on component. Equality in funding for programs between the schools. Gaps in equipment, for example Agua Fria's theater equipment is outdated. Sometimes the programs a kid wants to do are out of reach for their family economically, for example, construction is only available at Agua Fria. Often teachers are going out for the donations when they don't have time, and they don't have broad access to the people and resources."

Always giving opportunities for hands on learning. Multiple language offerings. Value bilingualism, and help kids see the value of it. Make it mandatory for every kid to be involved in at least one sport or club; tie this into advisory; your advisor could be your club sponsor or coach. Explicitly address the isolation kids feel from social media. Character education. Realize how kids learn and apply it, for instance kids like learning from video games, can it be incorporated?"

Barrier to mandatory sports and clubs is balancing out the most popular programs with ones that don't draw as many; a solution is for adults to intentionally bring in 'atypical' kids and help the find belonging. Have a time period to try out and sample differnt clubs or a structure that encourages them to try something.

Parents who work multiple jobs or long hours that make it tough for them to participate. Cost barriers for the community to participate in our school events and activities. Balancing new opportunities and ideas with basic needs for supplies and resources, especially considering the bond measure didn't pass. Needs for more people and better wages and salaries.

Super Saturday Form,doc302,Dreams,"I would love for us to get away from the traditional ""lines"" between science and math discipline courses and instead focus on connecting the connect across these disciplines so students can make more meaning out of it.  It becomes less abstract and more relevant/comprehensive.  For instance, focus on topics/themes/ problems which ask the students to work through the relevant standards that cross bio/chem/algebra all in one unit/scenario, etc.  This is more real world and authentic.  Students need to see the why behind the content of what they are learning not just learn the ""what"" in isolation.

My previous district used this system last year and it was very good for teacher and student mental health. Monday was a day for teachers to plan, grade and meet with parents and students. Student had time to get work done and get extra help during teacher virtual office hours. I never had year where I felt more prepared during the week. I believe by increasing the class time during the 4 days slightly to meet the required class time to allow for the 4 day week would be worth it. Class times as they are can be a bit short for project based classes like my own and the extra class time on the 4 days would allow for greater creativity and work time. This system could also save budget money as it is one day less of transportation."
Super Saturday Form,doc306,Priorities,Teacher and student mental health should be a priority. Teacher and student burn out are at an all time high. Allowing time for teachers to prepare during contracted hours would allow them to go into a weekend and be able to recharge.

Super Saturday Form,doc309,Priorities,"Classroom curriculum should be readily and easily available in plain English, not coded language."
Super Saturday Form,doc310,Dreams,"Teaching/Learning - I would like students to attend programs on other campuses; however, you need to involve those that know the state reporting requirements and those that would be managing that as someone still needs to monitor the students progress toward graduation which may be difficult if students are potential at multiple campuses.  I would like a testing coordinator and 504 Coordinator so these tasks are removed from the school counselors responsibilities which would free them up to work more with students to support their academic, social/emotional, and career/life development as they are educated, trained, and certified to do.

Whole Child - Increased opportunities for School Counselors, School Social Workers, and School Psychologist to collaborate and provide intentional supports for our students.  Build more partnerships with our community. Clearly defined policies, guidelines, staff roles for areas that impact our students.

Growth & opportunities - Reduce the caseloads of the positions mentioned above so they can better support the whole child.

Strategic Alliances - strengthen the relationships with district leadership and staff; understand many staff are also members of our community, parents of students at our schools and more; once those relationships improve, staff and their significant others, family members, etc can be a great resource for our students for example, potential job shadows, informational interviews, internships, etc; everyone we do business with should be willing to give back to our schools by supporting our students."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc556,NA,"It is good for grading essays because of the last in, but the weighting of all standards as the same does not work and can either inflate or deflate grades. Some standards need to be assessed but they may not be as important as other. Students want to see how they have done on an assignment and this is currently difficult. Students are not doing practice because there do not see the benefit of practice and feel like they can take a test and always be able to re- do it and have the advantage of seeing it at least once. Kids at this age are extrinsically motivated and grades motivate many of them. Student  accountability is a major problem. THe grading system with colleges or college board or even some of our resources like McGraw Hill do not align so this can cause extra work and confusion.  Grading has become a nightmare - this may be due to how we have set up the gradebook or how we assess, but I have to spend a lot of extra hours grading and it is affecting my quality of life. I am exhausted and frustrated."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc557,NA,I have taught content courses and trying to evaluate both content ( which is a must) and skills at the same time can be very time consuming. Just making a test and then pulling out grades for content and skills is very time consuming and we have little time to create effective test because we are trying to do all of this work while we are in the midst of teaching.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc558,NA,"THis gradebook is too hard to use - too many screens to access to create assignments and then entering grades is difficult - the score tab is useless. I input grades from the assignment/ standards screen but if if want to enter a series of grades for one student and then goto the next student is is very cumbersome. Even where the add assignment button is located causes problems when trying to put in grades or comments - its in the way and I have to spend time making sure my cursor is in exactly the right spot. Kids and parents can't read the gradebook - kids are always trying to figure out what score goes with what assignment, parents and students are confused by how it all works and what counts and doesn't count - it doesn't help that some departments use averages and others use last in. .  Percentages associated with the scores are inflating and deflating grades - they need to be adjusted  ( for instance a 4 should be at 93% a 3 at 85% ). When you mark an assignment missing it does not show up as missing on the screen in the main gradebook. So If I want a quick look at who has missing work I have to either run a report or click on the comment"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc559,NA,"I'm not sure it is actually assessing my students correctly - all standards are weighted equally but not all standards are equal so it can skew grades dramatically. It is very hard to get enough scores on all of the standards to really assess the student overall. FOr instance if I assess a couple of times may 2 on one standard but many times on another, the scores where I assessed many times may be accurate but the scores where I only assessed a couple of times may not be accurate, but they will have an impact on the overall grade which is what students, colleges and parents are concerned with. Even if I have multiple scores for a standard there is a chance that a student may just not do very well on a particular assignment, but if it is the last assignment it may affect their grade dramatically - they do have the opportunity to re-take, but that may or may not help. With an emphasis on assessments are we forgetting about the students who do not do well on tests. I know the intent is that assessments can be other things than tests, but then you are putting the burden on teachers to create and grade all of these different assessment types without providing appropriate time to make it work. The make it work while your trying to teach cannot continue - it leads to burnout and ineffective teaching and assessment. 
Many students have told me that percentages are an incentive to try harder for them. If they have for instance an 87% they will work a little harder to get that A . Even students who have a 93% will work harder to get a higher percentage. The 0-4 does not do the same thing. There is a lot more but I will stop here."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc560,NA,"Teaching to the standards is great, having rubrics to share will students is great - Getting rid of make work & extra credit. I'm just not sure we need SBG to do this."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc561,NA,There are some courses where SBG does not work - One size fits all is a failed type of thinking
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc562,NA,Choice. It fits some classes and not others.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc563,NA,"My kids, per AP, basically have to memorize 1400 terms concepts and then apply. If they don’t memorize them then application doesn’t matter. So SBG is not an accurate reflection if preparing them for the AP test and I hate not having a choice."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc564,NA,Skill based classes are fine but not every course is skill based. I also do not think it prepares them for college.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc565,NA,This grade book is t made for it. It’s a hot mess.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc567,NA,I think it does work in skill classes.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc568,NA,Course determined.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc569,NA,It is not working because of the grade book. The district rubrics either don’t exist or are DOK rubrics and not SBG rubrics.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc570,NA,It would be better for the content classes I’d the score was more binary. Did you complete the task? Did you do it correctly? That is the way College board assesses student performance.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc571,NA,Nothing. The grade book is crap and needs to burn.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc572,NA,Lack of consistency across the district. Lack of parent understanding. Lack of student interest to do practice. Ability for the slackers to take advantage of the reassess system.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc573,NA,It’s great in theory.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc574,NA,Students have quit doing work in class. They feel that if it is not graded it doesn't have to be done. It is a complete apathetic attitude. They don't want to make themselves better. It leads to false grades. The zeros are a problem or lack thereof. The reassessment period or the time to take the assessment needs to be defined. Even now students are trying to make up work from August. That is not reality. In a job you can't just turn in things whenever you want. We need to focus on really teaching life skills being on time completing work effectively. Colleges don't take work late we are not setting them up for success in their futures.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc575,NA,"more user friendly, no use of percentages. too many steps to get to grades, needs to be readable to teachers, parents and students."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc576,NA,We jumped before we had a platform that is designed for it. We are trying to fly the plane and build it in the air. Parents and students don't understand it. Teachers are doing their own thing and lack consistency.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc578,NA,"I like SBG in concept; however, it is not ensuring learning. It is encouraging minimal work and must easier to pass a class. Over achieving students will do the work no matter what the gradebook style."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc579,NA,Some of the standards are too broad and it makes grading difficult.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc580,NA,Entering grades for multiple standards is very time consuming.  It is also time consuming to find the standards to enter when creating the assignments.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc581,NA,It’s not how students are graded when they go to college.  We are not setting the students up for success.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc582,NA,The 0=50% and the ability to retest are the best parts of SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc583,NA,It is all-around a poor choice for grading and holding student accountable for their learning and success. Instead of teaching students to be college/career ready it sets them up to struggle in the real-world.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc584,NA,"Could see potential for English/Math classes but not for all other subjects (ex: Science, History, CTE, etc.)"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc585,NA,The gradebook works perfectly with traditional grading. It is SBG that complicates it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc586,NA,It is all-around a poor choice for grading and holding student accountable for their learning and success. Instead of teaching students to be college/career ready it sets them up to struggle in the real-world.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc587,NA,"Students, on average, have higher grades because the lowest option is a 50%."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc588,NA,SBG looks different in Science compared to Math/English core classes.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc589,NA,"Students do not have motivation to complete ungraded work, and SBG is confusing. The objectives under each standard vary and to have one grade based on the entire standard is an inaccurate representation of what students have learned or are capable of."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc591,NA,Easier read for students and parents
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc592,NA,It is difficult to grade English using this method- it doesn’t work because the scoring really needs to be truly black or white and English doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t give a good representation of student understanding and if a student turns in one assignment it can bump the grade an entire letter grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc593,NA,I would say it is very good for math. Read my response above for why I believe it isn’t good for English- this same reason would apply to Science and history as well.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc594,NA,The grade book worked great for traditional grading. The student and parent side of synergy is too confusing and I am unable to show students and parents how to look up missing assignments or grades because of my inability to access only one student.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc595,NA,It has given students the opportunity to turn in assignments very late and not perform at their best. It has created a population of students that will not be ready for college or career and that doing the absolute best the first time is unnecessary.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc596,NA,I don’t think there’s benefits.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc597,NA,"Students are not taking assessments seriously. In upper division sciences, students CANNOT be still learning the foundational material that was introduced in the beginning of the semester, while the schedule mandates the course to be at chapter 5, or 6 for example. So ""students can learn at their own pace"" does not apply to upper division sciences."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc598,NA,"When students realize that they can do as many retakes as they want, they don't take assessments seriously. If a teacher is making up a different retake, how many more retakes should a teacher make???? It's a lot more work for the teacher since students are not taking assessments seriously. Besides, if our goal is to get students ready for college, THERE ARE NO RETAKES IN COLLEGE!!! When teachers use the same assessment for the retake, then we are teaching students to the test."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc599,NA,"I don't currently do SBG. Incorporate standards into the tradional gradebook, but keep the %s"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc600,NA,Taking accountability completely away from students. Scale of 1 - 4 is very limited. There are ranges of proficiency in each standard and the scale does not paint a whole picture.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc601,NA,Incorporating the standards into the gradebook.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc602,NA,"Upper division sciences, like chemistry and physics cannot use SBG, it is extremely limiting and rigid."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc603,NA,Kids automatically “plan” for retake opportunity.  Kids never respect “due dates.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc604,NA,Content is almost impossible to cover with all the never ending retake opportunities.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc605,NA,More easily distinguishable assignments that are and aren’t for grading.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc606,NA,"It doesn’t prepare secondary level students for their next step in life; college or career.  At a job, you don’t get multiple chances to perform the same task before you’re fired.  In college if you don’t turn in an assignment on time, it’s usually not accepted."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc607,NA,Honestly none.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc608,NA,"I like that students have another chance to show what they know, especially if they have been working hard toward the goal of learning.  What doesn't work well, is that many students don't prepare fully because they know they can reassess if it doesnt go well and showing very minimal knowledge will earn a 1 (or a passing grade).  I also feel that SBG in upper level courses doesn't prepare students for what they will encounter in college since in most cases there aren't any redos in college."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc609,NA,"SBG is great for the hardworking student, regardless if they are a D student or an A student.  But for students with little motivation, they continue to struggle with completing practice that have no bearing on their grades which, then in turn, results in struggles on assessments since they don't prepare and practice on their own. 
Then, as a teacher, I am trying to reteach and encourage a student to reassess, when they have little internal motivation to do so."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc610,NA,"I don't agree with the fact that the last grade replaces all previous grades.  Some students will turn in something blank, thus earning a 0, wait a few weeks and then reassess only to have that 0 replaced without any consequences.  Synergy has everything nicely laid out and grouped for SBG."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc611,NA,"Practice not counting for anything.  Also, the final attempt replaces previous grades.  I also think SBG does prepare students for what will happen in college, so maybe it should be used more early in HS but then phased out as they got through the grades."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc612,NA,"It gives students a second chance to show what they know, especially if they just needed a little lol I get to learn it or needed just a little extra support."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc613,NA,"I wouldn't say it should be separated by department, but  more based on course."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc614,NA,50% equates to a zero. Students can do 1 assignment in 2 weeks timespan for grading and still pass.... no effort needed. More prep work on the teachers all to give away grades that are not earned.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc615,NA,Step by step for the setup is needed.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc616,NA,0 = 50%
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc617,NA,I like the idea of practice being done before assessment.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc618,NA,Modify grading system: mode instead of most recent or mean; make overarching domains/standards that are more big picture than having so many tiny standards (like Stevenson HS does); better gradebook for clearer reporting
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc619,NA,"I think we have too many standards and a confusing gradebook. Also, mode would be more reasonable for an accurate picture of student proficiency."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc620,NA,"Need mode, need clearer breakdown standards"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc621,NA,"We have all done it a little different, so there isn't a clear district vision. Our standard rubrics should be simplified and standardized across the district. We need actual expertise and training to make sure we are doing it with actual fidelity."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc622,NA,Not compliance-based or bogged down with nonsense points. Doesn't punish for not needed practice. Should have a more clear idea of what students can do.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc623,NA,"SBG would not work for my students because I teach loow ability students, and they would not complete the practice assignments if they are not graded.  Hence, they would skip the practice (very important in math class) and recive low or failing grades on assessments."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc624,NA,"I like the new changes to Synergy, but I do not use SBG."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc625,NA,Students are not accountable for most of the assignments. They cannot up their grade by attending AOT.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc626,NA,Creation of easier (quality over quantity) formal assessments in SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc627,NA,"SBG should be used on project or skill based classes, like PE, dance, arts."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc628,NA,I would like to give participation style points in my gradebook and hold student accountable with all assignments. Practices in the grade book for non-grading is BEYOND frustrating for everyone involved.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc629,NA,Students feel less than when they only get a 3 on an assignment. It’s hard to give 4’s. I want them to feel accomplished in my class and not just average.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc630,NA,"Participation points, homework, professionalism in the classroom need to be accounted for."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc631,NA,I like the old format of the gradebook. New updates with too many things to create/select get overwhelming. I just want to create an assignment in the gradebook and add in the appropriate points. Stop making things too fancy and too extra. I have enough on my plate. There is no need to decorate the gradebook and make it so in depth with settings and adjustments that I have to be super trained to make it work. Let me just grade!!!!!
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc632,NA,The practice assignments up to assessments are not being done by students.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc633,NA,The 4 point scale is easy to enter in.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc634,NA,Nobody should be forced out of their own teaching autonomy.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc635,NA,Grading practice work but at a capped weight of 10 to 20 percent. Have limits on late work and allow for deadlines
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc636,NA,"NA"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc637,NA,Doesn't prepare students for college or career success. The lack of deadlines doesn't reflect adult life. Difficult for parents and students to understand.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc638,NA,The growth mindset is good but that could be accomplished other ways.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc639,NA,The departments that it works best for like math can use it while others grade in a way that works for them. Math shouldn't always make decisions for the rest of us
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc640,NA,"Problems: can't make changes to the assignment without re entering all grades,  kids/ parents don't understand it"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc641,NA,One size does not fit all
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc642,NA,It does not hold students accountable in practicing the standards and because of no graded homework their grades do not change until an assessment.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc643,NA,It does not work because of accountability
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc644,NA,Synergy is very difficult to use with SBG and takes longer to grade anything
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc645,NA,"Grading material, difficulty grading, accountability, false information in data"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc646,NA,There are none
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc647,NA,"I believe that it is based on how each teacher teaches, there are always different ways to teach so we should have the freedom to do what we feel is best for our students, after all we are the ones that see them everyday and see how the act, participate and practice everyday. i have never seen district in a classroom on a daily basis"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc648,NA,"Rebrand it, focus on big picture assessment, mandatory trainings district wide, emphasize that laziness is a behavior and not an academic issue"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc649,NA,Gradebook is still clunky.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc650,NA,It lags when entering data.  It does a great job with item analysis.  I can pin point strengths and weaknesses within student growth.   Need better training.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc651,NA,Teaching students to take advantage of reassessment and knowing they can always improve.   Some students have been punished by the traditional system.  Need mandatory training.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc652,NA,"Strictly evidence based, separates behavior and grade.  Provides psychological motivation for growth with the 50-100 scale.  Good tool to see organized data to see student needs.  Great for conferencing."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc653,NA,Students need to be held accountable for classwork/homework and zeros should be allowed.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc654,NA,I don't use it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc655,NA,There need to be standards for content and citizenship (community service.)
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc656,NA,Students are not held accountable for anything but assessment.  Grading is a nightmare for teachers just starting and the gradebook does not make it any easier.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc657,NA,"Students truly show what they know, not just compliance."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc658,NA,SBG may not be applicable to all content.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc659,NA,Students do not complete practice because the scores do not directly count.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc660,NA,Students do not practice and still pass  because a 0 is 50% and they just need to pass with ones to pass the course.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc661,NA,Syncing with google classroom has major limitations with sbg  causes double the work.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc662,NA,Does not teach responsibility to study in order to achieve mastery.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc663,NA,Makes the courses easy to pass.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc664,NA,Some academic courses do not  benefit by using sbg
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc665,NA,"1. Some practice assignments that directly tie to standard would be graded.
2. Practice assignments tied to standard would be required for re-assessments.
3. Mode would be used to calculate the grade instead of mean or most recent."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc666,NA,Most students don’t do assignments until they are entered into the gradebook.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc667,NA,Students will try their best if they know something impacted their grade and don’t “chase” points as much as I have seen in the past.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc668,NA,Mode being an option to calculate grades. The software automatically calculating a students grade as incomplete if they did not do enough assignments/assessments.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc669,NA,It’s not done the same way school or district wide.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc670,NA,Fewer students chase points. More try their best on assessments
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc671,NA,I would keep the assessments about the objectives so students know the goals. But would have some practice worth points to motivate students.  Also would get rid of the 0-4 scale and go back to A-F since that is what it translates to anyways.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc672,NA,No matter how often I go over the objective/standard even my smarter students don't care to make the connection.  StudentVue for SBG is a mess. Parents and the ESS department still don't seem to understand practice won't affect grades.  There are not really good models of science assessments that have questions geared towards SBG.  If a student gets 10 out of 10 that is 100% which is a 4 which then the grade book translates back to 100%.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc673,NA,1 view and 1 type of grade. . .either As or 4s but not both.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc674,NA,We are trying to fit traditional grading into a SBG box.  Like trying to fit a square in a circle.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc675,NA,Students being able to retake assessments.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc676,NA,"Teaching math is about the process of solving problems, not necessarily the result. However, with the rubrics, a student either can get the correct result or (s)he can't, there's no in-between anymore, no partial credit for the work done, especially with the stipulation from admin that only whole number grade must be used. To my point of view, in math, SBG only works well for the more advanced students, the ones able to get the correct answer every time."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc677,NA,"As soon as students learn that the ""practice"" doesn't count for their grade, they stop doing it and try to wing it during quizzes."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc678,NA,"The gradebook is so complicated as to be almost unworkable. There are so many useless features, getting what I actually would want out of it is too convoluted and I make do with just reporting grades."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc679,NA,Why do we need SBG to begin with?
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc680,NA,Not really sure I see any benefit. I only use it because it's a condition of my continued employment.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc681,NA,"Maybe SBG works for subjective content areas such as English and history, but I feel math needs more flexibility than rubrics provide."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc682,NA,Kids know how to manipulate the system. They know what assignments to do and the ones to ignore. They do not see any point or benefit to completing a practice assignment if it'll not impact their grades. Therefore many are settling for just passing with Cs and Ds. If they don't do the practice they are not always meeting grade level standards. This may lead to more reteaching in the end.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc683,NA,Its glitchy and it too sensitive to how you put in stuff
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc684,NA,More accurate represent mastery of state standards
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc685,NA,It should reflect more in areas where simple forms of understanding can be seen. With English theres a lot of grey areas.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc686,NA,get rid of 0=50%; not use the 4.0 scale
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc687,NA,I don't know what the answer is
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc688,NA,"communicating learning with parents and students; kids asking if assignements are ""for a grade"""
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc689,NA,gets rid of things like points for bathroom passes and brining in kleenex
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc690,NA,More accountability on the students daily effort and work towards their grades.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc691,NA,More accountability
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc692,NA,Students lack of need to complete work for their grades. Seems to be more of a manipulation by students of the system.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc693,NA,I don’t see many past it inflates GPAs
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc694,NA,I think for more content and less skill driven courses they should be able to choose their grade book types.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc695,NA,Average the scores for each standard. Students have figured out the most recent evidence game.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc696,NA,"Students know that if we are going to reassess on a standard, they will not preform well on the initial assessment because they know that grade will be replaced entirely."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc697,NA,I like that you can now add grades when making the assignment. Assignment view is also helpful when assessing multiple standards in the same assignment.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc698,NA,"Students know that they can reassess if they do poorly and that their bad grade will be replaced when we reassess. Because of this, they often do not attempt or purposely preform poorly. Most recent evidence should not be used. Instead, the average of the scores should be taken."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc699,NA,"I would just like to get rid of it totally. The kids can't figure out which assignment they are missing in the grade book. It is very time consuming to put grades in as one assignment can cover 3-5 standards so you are putting in the rubric score 5 times for one assignment. Synergy is not user friendly for SBG. It is literally like putting a square in a round hole. Also, lets be real... College doesn't use SBG so I feel like we are setting the kids up for failure as they all think they can just turn things in late (no penality) as well as redo assignments. Life isn't like that, and college classes definitely are not like that."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc700,NA,English department has it set up for the most current grade... This is really messing up the Freshman and are very discouraged. The standards that we are to cover this semester do not align up with the curriculum that was given to us. This is when it would be nice to have traditional and not so many questions. I miss projects for kids to create something on a kleenex box for extra credit so that I can have a supply of tissues. Can't have that now that we have SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc701,NA,It is how our department has it set up for the most current assessment will be their grade. The kids get upset when their is a fun project but it doesn't really apply to a standard and it will be a practice assignment. The curriculum we are using does not align up with the standards that we are required to work on that semester.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc702,NA,To be able to put in the grades quicker instead of having to click on multiple boxes. I couldn't figure out the new technique so I am still using classic grade book.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc703,NA,Way to much prep ahead of time work along with creating rubrics and then finding time to modify the rubric.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc704,NA,The students can only get a 50% and not any lower.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc705,NA,"Not all departments have standards or curriculum to follow. For example, theatre to use a standard? Or Digital photography? The elective classes i can see why no SBG. I also think History and English shouldn't have it either as it is a very subjective unit. Overall just get rid of it. We are so overwhelmed and this grading system doesn't help."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc706,NA,"Students are losing out on content. We build our classes, at least my class around events in history. We can use that history to develop theories and give the students an opportunity for free thought. However, with the lack of ability to teach content in a way in which students are held accountable for the content, they simply by-pass the content they need to be a productive citizen versed in civics and history and focus on abstract ideas that are void of historical relevance. In addition, without any way to hold students accountable for smaller assignments that might not be graded, students lose out on gaining a deeper understanding of the content. It is irresponsible to neglect a students work ethic and chances of deeper understanding. In short, students are void of real understanding of content and we are producing students unwilling to work."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc707,NA,"History specifically, I cannot speak for others is class in which we use skills such as research, analytical thinking, and source analysis. in the past these tools supported the content and developed student into critical thinkers that had a grasp on the content. However,  with SBG we reverse the idea of using skills to support content, we now use content to support skills which has produced a negative effect in understanding the critical ideas of history. I have used, adapted, modified, tweaked, and experimented with SBG for the past 4 years and have seen the same results; less understanding of critical knowledge and a reduction of not just quality work, but a reduction in work being done as a whole."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc708,NA,"It is fine, SBG is a flawed system. The fact that we cannot create a gradebook that works seamlessly for this system should be telling."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc709,NA,"Ungraded practice, lack incentive for students. There is no carrot for them to gain from doing the work. Why would an employee work hard on something not to earn a wage? As such, without graded practice, we incentivize nothing. In addition, removing weights from various topics (quiz, projects, homework, etc.) allows students to pick and choose what to participate with and what not to. I have spent weeks on a project with students, just to have them not do it and have that grade replaced later with a simple quiz. Students that do nothing all year, pass the class by doing 3 or 4 assessments during a semester and pass a class. A 0 is 50%?! This idea is Ludacris! Lets think about college and career readiness...a student gets a job and never shows up for work...should that employee be paid 50% of what they would have earned?"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc710,NA,None. This is a twisted method that should be removed from education entirely.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc711,NA,"Education preaches differentiation. If something doesn't work we adapt and find what does. SBG has been tried, tested, and forced upon us...yet it had been found wanting."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc712,NA,"I like the idea of homework and small assignments not being figured into their grade. However, students view it as they don't need to do the work. They would rather take a test, see how they do, then do the assignments so they retake the test if need be. Also, it is difficult, especially in math, to test only one standard at a time. Some questions have multiple standards to them. Spiraling in previous concepts is difficult under SBG. I prefer tests that include other concepts (standards). Likewise projects in math can be difficult to assess into one standard. I would be okay with taking the idea of every grade is always 50% or higher, like a zero in SBG, students can retake a test once or twice in a short time window, but be able to just make a test or project without it being just one standard and allow for more freedom to spiral in content. Also, I would make test and projects like 90% of the grade with small assignments and home work be 10%. Just enough that they have to do some of it to get an A in the class."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc713,NA,See my longer answer above.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc714,NA,"NA"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc715,NA,"Since we adopted a new textbook for math, I think the test should just be simple like chapter 2 test and so on. If that test covered 3 standards, then so be it. I dont think breaking it down into three assessment scores is the best way. We can more easily adopt and use the great textbook resources (like the tests in the textbook) when we can just grade them traditionally. I think it is important to teach each standard, and even test each standard, but not necessarily make an entire assessment for each standard and learning target."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc716,NA,"For students, it is easier to come back from a ""zero""  grade ."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc717,NA,"I think classes that don't need to spiral review or build on previous concepts, could adopt SBG easier than math and others."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc730,NA,"Due to overwhelming absences, I did not require 70% completion of practices in order to earn the credit. 
I did not want to go down that road. 
I have students who are passing at a 61% because  They were minimally proficient in the first two categories. They haven’t established proficiency in the next two. 
I find it incredibly frustrating that a few will pass when they really aren’t even demonstrating a minimal proficiency in all categories. 
Maybe this is a syllabus thing fir next semester."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc735,NA,"I would like to think all teachers do what is the best practice for their students. The SBG model isn’t horrible.

I think this type of environment is hindering good work ethics and we will lose good teachers as well. It sounds like more work for teachers and less accountability for students if you can take the test as many times as you want ---is that college and career ready ?"

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc753,NA,"I would like to modify SBG to include some sort of incomplete. I know synergy doesn't work with the incomplete. But if students pass a few standards and choose not to do the rest of the standards they take a 0--but because the 0 is only 50% they can still pass the class very easily--this means we will be moving on kids who didn't really complete the course, they just did enough to pass."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc754,NA,"SBG is currently working great---the main problem I have is with students not completing all of the standards and therefore passing the class even though they did less than half of the work. Because there is no incomplete, as long as a student passes a few standards then they will pass the class."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc755,NA,"I would like to see percentages go away, incompletes pop up when they haven't completed more than half of the standards. The grade book that we were shown through stevenson high school was amazing. If we could have something like that then SBG would really be easier for both teachers and students."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc756,NA,"No incompletes, teachers not having similar rubrics across content, teacher training in SBG-- I feel a lot of teachers aren't sure on what they are doing."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc757,NA,I like that students are proficient in a standard/not just a class. I like that homework/practice isn't graded against them. I like that they get the opportunity to reassess to show proficiency.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc758,NA,"Tweak conversion scale, give teachers the OPTION to use it"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc759,NA,"AP courses demand more rigor than SBG allows. Additionally, if we want to get students college and career ready, unlimited retakes are an impediment."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc760,NA,See above
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc761,NA,Why does everything need to be set up at the district level? It prevents teachers from making easy changes.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc762,NA,"Lack of accountability, conflict with ACT, AP"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc763,NA,"Promotes growth mindset, especially in math"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc764,NA,Teacher choice breeds improvement
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc765,NA,"They can make up quizzes WHENEVER they want nearly. No accountability. Takes too much time to develop rubrics, it hand goes teachers who are experienced and know what is best for THEIR kids. The grading system is not realistic either. The unfair zero is in fact, fair. Students need to learn that they can’t miss assignments and still get credit. If we are going to be SBG and be literalists, then why not have a freshmen test test out of Senior level classes? We are, in fact, or should be, teaching students more than Academics. It’s hard to teach the whole person because we are SO focused on academics and SBG is on paper QUITE Academic, but I would argue it in fact actually LOWERS test scores. It’s a one size fits all curriculum that takes away teacher autonomy;; and it doesn’t work!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc766,NA,Maybe Math.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc767,NA,Get rid of SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc768,NA,Stated already
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc769,NA,Great for new teaches because they have support from CAT/PLC.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc770,NA,Teachers should be left to taught what they think is best for students. CAT/PLC meetings should be held once a month.  I do not believe the teacher lottery is harmful. It’s a way to explain things to parents.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc771,NA,N/A
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc772,NA,Scrap SBG
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc773,NA,SBG does not hold students accountable on a regular and consistent basis.  It is quite challenging to teach students accountability and responsibility when grading occurs at distant intervals or as a result of assessments.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc774,NA,None
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc775,NA,"SBG is unworkable and should be scrapped.  Traditional grading better reinforces student accountability and, more importantly performance."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc776,NA,I wouldn't modify it. I like having the option to be hybrid.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc777,NA,I use SBG as a 90% (assessment) and 10% (practice). It is a 4 point scale. It IS WORKING!!
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc778,NA,It works well in English for me.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc779,NA,"I do not need any changes, I am content with how my gradebook looks currently."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc780,NA,"It's all I've ever known since I've started my teaching, I don't have any major problems that I can identify just yet. I'm content."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc781,NA,"Simple math, re-assessment opportunities are nice, and assessments mean a lot."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc782,NA,"It is still basically averaging scores. There’s no clear advantage. Plus, breaking the new curriculum down into individual standards for assessment is impossible and an impractical waste of time. Students and parents don’t understand this system and district is not able to explain it well enough to justify. It makes it very difficult to have a student’s grade accurately reflect their performance in class."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc783,NA,"It does not work in an English class. English is not broken down into one standard at a time. We’ve worked hard to make it work,  but it doesn’t. Forcing us to use a new curriculum that is not divided into focus standards while making us assess in a way that is feels frustrating and cruel."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc784,NA,The grade book should be traditional.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc785,NA,"It’s unrealistic, unproven, doesn’t reflect college assessments, encourages students to turn in inferior work, and causes more grade book confusion than is necessary. It’s a made up system that no one uses in the real world for good reason."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc786,NA,"Someone gets paid to host conferences, and sometimes teachers get a break from their classrooms to attend them. It’s nice to get vacations when they’re out of town."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc787,NA,Math and English are not the same. Trying to structure and assess them the same way is idiotic and bad teaching.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc788,NA,The current gradebook was not meant for SBG.  We are constantly having to reenter grades into the gradebook or enter them 2 times to count to students grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc789,NA,Student accountability and how it works with the synergt
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc790,NA,"I would increase student accountability, having a cutoff or some reduction for late submissions on ""assessments"" such as labs or projects because students have ample time to complete these but lose focus when there is no penalty."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc791,NA,"SBG has inflated grades in my class. The gradebook makes using SBG difficult and very time consuming. For AP classes, SBG is not efficient because I often assess 5 standards on a quiz or test and have not found an efficient way to grade this. If there is true SBG, I do not believe we should translate it to a grade. A 3 which is proficient also translates to an 88% which is high in my opinion. I believe it should be closer to an ""85"" or an 80 if we must continue associating the numbers with letter grades. What I am unsure about is whether there should be more consistencies with teachers so the policies are similar or if we had more options. What works for a science class would hardly work for a math or a reading class based on the standards we have. I would also like more time to modify the SLOs. These are often submitted at Summer PD Academy, but there are not as many teachers' input. When I get to those in the school year, they are very limiting, and I think they do not encompass all that is required to cover in the standards. I also think that the MTE should count for students because we are required to give it, but for what reason if it only measures my teaching but students do not study for them or give their best effort if they know it has no impact on them."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc792,NA,"There are varying essential standards. In a reading class, they may focus on skills, and in a math class they may focus more on content standards. In science there are both skills and content standards, so it is tough to balance those making sure we have all of those SLOs in the gradebook."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc793,NA,"I think it is very difficult for students to read and understand their grades with the current setup. I also wish there was an easier way to set ""favorite"" standards so I do not have to scroll through each course's set. There may be a way to do this but I am unaware."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc794,NA,"Student accountability, as well as functional and practical RTI methods. I have AOT, but with all students across three different classes trying to take different assessments over (or a different standard within that assessment) it is very difficult to set straight which students need which assessments as well as help everyone relearn the material."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc795,NA,"Students have evidence to demonstrate how their grades reflect what they are supposed to be learning in the course. Basically, if we rebranded this to be evidence based, I think that would fit better across several areas."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc796,NA,"While I like consistency, I cannot speak for everyone. I think there should be a set handbook like there is, but at least the option based on the site."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc797,NA,Isolating skills in English is not how English works. SBG is also not aligned at all with the new curriculum
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc798,NA,"If it is going to be 4 point scale, it should not convert to percent, just make it a 4 point scale"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc799,NA,"The theory of it is great, in practice, it is not appropriate for English to isolate skills. Having rubrics is fine. Reassessment is a mess."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc800,NA,Everyone grading based on the same rubric
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc801,NA,It is not appropriate for English
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc802,NA,"Allow for decimal points to further break down the grade - like 3.25, 3.5, etc. in order to ensure students aren’t getting the same final grade for different levels of mastery."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc803,NA,The biggest problem is that students can get a wide range of scores but still end up with the same grade due to how the math breaks down. How do 4 points really show mastery?
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc804,NA,With SBG there is no push for students to complete the practice as they are not graded on it. So when it comes to assessments they haven’t done the work to master the skill.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc805,NA,It’s easy to input grades once the standards have been downloaded.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc806,NA,"With SBG there is no push for students to complete the practice as they are not graded on it. So when it comes to assessments they haven’t done the work to master the skill. Also, with SBG the grade tends to not be cumulative over the skills, but rather take the last assessment for the grade. So students can wait until the end of the grading period to actually try to get a good grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc807,NA,"It is easier to check for mastery, and rubrics are easier to develop."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc808,NA,"I didn't choose this but I am using a hybrid version currently. If we had to keep SBG but modify it, I would add some way to include professionalism, work ethic, and responsibility into the students' grades. The SBG allows little to no opportunity for this and only focuses on their ""mastery of the content standard,"". This sounds great but in its true essence, this is not preparing them for any real world applications and SBG does not support our motto of college and career readiness."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc809,NA,"Its working for those students who hardly do anything, to pass and skate by."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc810,NA,It is easier in some (i.e. math and science) and much more difficult for others (i.e. cte and social studies).
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc811,NA,"All 4 grading periods to be selected everytime you make an assignment, automatically each semester."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc812,NA,"The fact that professionalism, work ethic (especially work ethic) and responsibility  has no merit and affect on their grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc813,NA,Kids pass easier (which is not a benefit for some as well)
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc814,NA,"It works better for some, and not at all for others."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc815,NA,We have in place the unfair zero. With that being said a student can pass CTE with only doing 10% of the work. With only doing 10% of the work- it doesn't prepare them for the state test in year 2 or any certifications that might need along the way.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc816,NA,"C being the passing grade. The students have the motto ""D's get diplomas"" and they get to play sports with doing the very minimal work- which in turn means they are learning the bare minimal."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc817,NA,"In reality, adhering to standards-based grading with fidelity is counterproductive and leads to a lowering of expectations. D's get degrees!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc818,NA,I am CTE and I can't see any.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc819,NA,I already count 'practice' as a professionalism grade. It doesn't help with making the students accountable. 95% of the students never retake an assessment no matter what their grade is. Some students are good at tests- while others are good at projects- while others are good at busy work. I thought we were supposed to teach ALL learners? SBG only caters to the cram test takers.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc820,NA,SBG is harder in English courses than in others.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc821,NA,Keeping the latest score does not work.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc822,NA,"Students play the system and turn in incomplete work. Then they play the ""revise/resubmit"" game, only fixing in pieces until they get the score they want rather than fixing it the first time. Teachers don't follow SBG the same, so grades still aren't the same in classes."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc823,NA,"Rubrics make it easier to grade, but we don't need SBG for that."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc824,NA,Students are not incentivised to do assignments that are not for a grade. Homework turn in rates are low.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc825,NA,Have specific learning objectives for each course. When only the standards are used (example physics) it can take us 2 months to finish one standards.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc826,NA,"Not being implemented the same in each class, so students are confused."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc827,NA,Incentivises students to retake exams and fix mistakes.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc828,NA,"Students are not motivated to retest, or attempt practice. This does not promote true mastery as students can pass without putting much work into it or fully understanding the content which will cause them to struggle more in future math classes."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc829,NA,"If I enter in an assessment, I have to enter it into the gradebook twice, one for the grade to actually change and another spot for students to see their score on StudentVue."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc830,NA,"Promotes students to be lazy, many students are fine with barely passing because they did well on one assessment."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc831,NA,"Maybe it works with some departments but not all. I feel like students tried harder in math with traditional grading. Math skills are constantly being taught and used in later math classes but this is not true with all other subjects. Math is constantly taught, and scaffolded, we need students to practice all skills."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc832,NA,"Basically, if  a student gets 10 percent in my class...he passes"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc833,NA,I don't know...it is just difficult to work with
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc834,NA,"It is not legitimate. It is giving studnets grades, that they do not deserve. This will hurt them, in the long run"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc835,NA,They have time to make up missed work
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc836,NA,"The rubric works well for grading assignments if they are set up for each assignment. 4=10, 3=8.8, 2=7.6 and 1=6.4. A zero should be a 0 to create immediacy to complete missing assignments."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc837,NA,"SBG is not a one-size-fits-all. Teachers should have a choice. Ultimately, it is their grade book and are responsible for the outcome. We are not using full SBG the way it was originally intended. It works well for math and elementary, but other subject areas have elements that need to be modified to fit their curriculum and standards. SBG does not work well with the some curriculum or for all subjects."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc838,NA,"Math works well (all of the examples are from math). English is more difficult as our standards are better when blended together. At the elementary level, specific skills can be taught separately as they are learning many for the first time, but by the time high school standards are the focus, they are the same thing again for 4 more years."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc839,NA,Works: choice of standard or SBG
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc840,NA,It is more difficult for students who do what is expected to get an A and easier for students who hardly do anything to pass with a D.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc841,NA,4-point rubrics
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc842,NA,"Again, teachers are professionals and should determine what works best for their situation."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc843,NA,Parents don't understand and we cannot gives 0s for students who don't even try to do the work.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc844,NA,The no 0 policy is a problem.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc845,NA,Be able to assign 0s
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc846,NA,Not being able to give 0s for no attempt. Parents don't understand. Assessments should only be a part of the grade. Not 80%.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc847,NA,In theory it's great but the way we are forced to implement it at afhs is the problem.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc848,NA,Assessments should never be a majority of the grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc849,NA,"It is not aligned with the new district English curriculum, and it is also not teaching ""college and career ready"""
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc850,NA,"It is not aligned with the new district English curriculum, and it is also not teaching ""college and career ready"""
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc851,NA,More alignment and structure with new curriculum
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc852,NA,"Hard to make rubrics for with new curriculum, not ""college and career ready"". Also, English is SO different. Using a text and just teaching and assessing theme one week is so pinpointed and boring."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc853,NA,Knowing where the students are at with each standard.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc854,NA,"SBG removes the incentive for students to learn anything other than the standards being assessed. Even then, students are less inclined to pursue anything past a proficiency mark. Students see level 4 understanding as impossible to achieve, and therefore do not put forth the effort to even try. The practice/classwork is viewed as futile and insignificant (the students have communicated this stance). Since practice/homework does not contribute to overall grade, the current intervention programs such as Power Hour, Edge Academy, and math/English labs only minimally service students in comparison to previous years."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc855,NA,"SBG was designed for English courses and does not work well, in practice, with math courses where skills build upon themselves in a very sequential order. Also, AP courses are another ball game and are governed by College Board. They have their own rubrics, skills, and question styles that do not need to fit our SBG format."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc856,NA,Traditional grading worked fine in the gradebook.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc857,NA,"Forcing SBG practices sounds a lot like micromanaging a profession where there is already such a shortage. For a district that is focused on being college and career ready, I feel that this is contrary to that mission. Colleges/universities are not SBG and statistical studies have shown that the dropout rate of programs in fields such as nursing has increased because they do not get unlimited chances to demonstrate understanding. There are consequences and liabilities for when professionals make mistakes. Students need to understand this. Officials need to recognize that all teachers are teaching and assessing the standards, but SBG grading practices are no more ""standardized"" than traditional grading practices."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc858,NA,The makeup procedures
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc859,NA,I haven’t really implemented it yet. I am somewhat but still haven’t fully done so since being at New Directions
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc860,NA,We don’t have access to the grade book at New Directions
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc861,NA,Makeup procedures
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc862,NA,Supportive
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc863,NA,"The Social Studies standards do not lend themselves to the structure of SBG as they are skills-based and pertain to the practice if historical method. They are year-long standards that cannot be mastered within a single unit of study or a single topic. Also, students lack motivation to apply themselves since it is very difficult to fail. The majority of non-graded assignments are « missing » and I feel that the knowledge base of the students after graduation will be much lower than at more rigorous schools. We are amplifying socio-economic disparities and not preparing students for college and careers."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc864,NA,The new social studies standards are not based on content but rather on skills and historical method.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc865,NA,"I use SBG grading but do not have my entire grade book set to SBG, because I am aware of the problems associated with it."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc866,NA,"Too much time and effort are being dedicated to making it work. This indicates to me that it is not tenable. It correlates to math but seemingly to no other subject or course. If we were to calculate the cost in dollars that the district has dedicated to SBG, we would be at a net $ loss in productivity. Teachers should be spending more time on lesson design and student support."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc867,NA,Teachers better align their assessments to the course standards.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc868,NA,It does not work with year-long standards or for overlapping and standards. The practical of historical method and analytical skill is not conducive to the design of SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc869,NA,"Give teachers choice of hybrid until we improve SBG district wide. Less autonomy across the district and offer REAL rubrics and assessments teachers in all 5 schools use. Utilize school city and create a bank of questions for educators to utilize. Utilize resources from marzano on SBG. Many have wrong ideas of what SBG is, such as only short- answer questions can be on assessments when gurus of SBG (Marzano) do not state that at all."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc870,NA,I am currently using SBG but not the synergy SBG gradebook since it has many complaints. SBG has forced our PLC to create rubrics which help us grade more consistently across all our classes.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc871,NA,I am still not using the synergy SBG gradebook due to complaints over the last couple of years since till out.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc872,NA,Inconsistency across district schools. Individuals making decisions about SBG but not utilizing resources from the gurus of SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc873,NA,Gives students opportunity to actually LEARN. They can see their growth from formatives to summarizes throughout the year.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc874,NA,"I say no because if certain consistent things are not created and available then departments should not be forced into it. As mentioned before, test banks for consistent assessments across campuses, consistent rubrics across campuses."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc875,NA,"An English-based curriculum is extremely difficult to adapt to SBG. Short stories, novels, poems, etc. are not meant to be taught through a single standard. We are doing a disservice to students by making them think they can read an entire chapter or short story and only analyze one skill. Literature must be analyzed fully."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc876,NA,I've heard SBG works well for contents that have standards that build on each other.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc877,NA,"The traditional grade book would be easier in an English course. Still eliminating the unfair zero is fine, but having to single out standards in the grade book is difficult."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc878,NA,"It's not as practical as it is made up to be. We are still averaging grades in the grade book anyway, so we are really just creating arbitrary grades on a 4 point scale (i.e. a 10 question multiple choice test on a 4 point scale is useless)"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc879,NA,Allowing students to reassess is helpful sometimes
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc880,NA,SBG works better in some departments than it does in others. All examples and explanations given by District are math and science examples. No one can explain how to use SBG well in an English class.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc881,NA,The grade book needs to match the concept better
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc882,NA,Software issues
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc883,NA,Make our own.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc884,NA,Coming understandings
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc885,NA,Actual measures
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc886,NA,All need the same understanding before it will work
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc887,NA,"Don’t like it, don’t want it!!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc888,NA,A student who does nothing and masters nothing can still pass a class with no to little effort. It enables students to be lazy.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc889,NA,It doesn’t work. Lazy students who are not mastering content can still pass a class.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc890,NA,Just go away from SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc891,NA,It doesn’t work. Lazy students who are not mastering content can still pass a class
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc892,NA,None
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc893,NA,"Again, SBG rewards lazy academic behaviors. It is not a real indication of Mastery."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc894,NA,"SBG, despite its name, is not good for grading. It is good for enhancing the authenticity and fairness of education. There's nothing in particular about the way grades are being reported that is helpful educationally."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc895,NA,"Motivation killer. Even though I keep the rigor high in my class, it is the worst-kept-secret that kids can ""do nothing until the end""."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc896,NA,"It is clear how this could be used in Math or in other content areas where knowledge is cumulative. I feel our SBG ""experts"" don't see how this applies in other content areas"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc897,NA,"Very little works with the current gradebook. Much time is spent trying to determine what factors are influencing grades, and grades almost never reflect in-class participation."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc898,NA,Obscured grades and a sense of pointlessness
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc899,NA,Authenticity in assessment
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc900,NA,"not until there are worthwhile standards across the board. standards need to evolve beyond guidelines and need to be explicit bits of info. if we see such a revolution in what the state expects us to instruct, I could see it working then."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc901,NA,"Synergy needs to indicate an ""incomplete"" when a student has not submitted enough assignment. Missing assignments count as a 50% until made up. 

EVERY TEACHER NEEDS TO BE DOING THE SAME THING"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc902,NA,"SBG works when we utilize a hybrid form. It's a faulty system (since Synergy does not indicate an ""incomplete"" when a student has not submitted enough assignment). 

PARTICIPATION, ATTENDANCE, BEHAVIOR, AND EFFORT NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN GRADING. CREATE A PROFESSIONALISM SLO FOR ALL PROGRAMS."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc903,NA,"Synergy needs to indicate an ""incomplete"" when a student has not submitted enough assignment."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc904,NA,"SBG is not perfect for CTE. Some CTE courses use the same SLO's for multiple projects throughout the ENTIRE Program (levels 1, 2, 3, & 4). SBG needs to be a hybrid for some CTE courses as we do not follow a similar SLO progression as content courses."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc905,NA,Simple grading. Fair Grading. Students understand what areas they struggled on and what they need to work on.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc906,NA,It is too rigid. There is no way to provide extra credit. The standards are not the only pathway to learn. 1-4 scale is not helpful.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc907,NA,I think the scaling is very difficult to use. Students are often between 3-4 but there is no gradation allowed.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc908,NA,Allow partial credit. Like 3.5 instead of just whole numbers.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc909,NA,"Standards are not a good way to assess learning. Students need to be working on multiple forms of assignments from presentations to written essays. Not everything is a standard, but we cannot really prioritize anything but standards right now."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc910,NA,"Major benefits, everyone knows the standards and it is common language within departments"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc911,NA,"Some departments I think it is easier to use SBG. However, it is really hard to grade multiple standards and put in multiple grades off of just one essay"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc912,NA,don't use
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc913,NA,parents do not understand SBG and the lack of consistency is confusing for all stakeholders
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc914,NA,SBG and Synergy has gotten better
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc915,NA,It has not been an easy transition with the Social Sciences subject area. With the adjustments with synergy it has helped some.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc916,NA,"Social Sciences as stated above, has been a struggle and not always easy to represent."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc917,NA,"It has been a bit better with some changes, but it has been a struggle getting an accurate display of the students capabilities - ESS students for an example."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc918,NA,"AP grade at times are unable to improve once they have a 4, extra credit can help but this requires creativity in the grade book. Which then isn't a accurate show of a grade with the 1 - 4 grading system."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc919,NA,"Not sure, when it was first presented it sounded great. I really liked the idea that we could assess the knowledge of the Standards, but it hasn't been that easy as it was presented. We have Administration asking for teachers to use it when they have never tried it when they had been teacher, and Synergy has been a big issue until this year."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc920,NA,"As stated above, with Social Sciences it has been a struggle. I can not comment on other subjects."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc921,NA,Use some of the wonderful ideas if SBG and mis it with traditional grading

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc938,NA,Doesn't apply to ESS-We don't have standards
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc939,NA,It is really difficult to make exams and projects sbg for a language
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc940,NA,It’s not working for quizzes or exams. We test different standards in one test so we need multiple rubrics or sections. That makes it difficult to have SBG
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc941,NA,"It’s not very user friendly. I would like some kind of workshop on how to use the grade book. Sometime I’m asked to do things on synergy, but no one seems to know how to show me how to complete that task"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc942,NA,"SBG is working; however, students sometimes get a false sense of grade security because of the last grade being the one counted - SBG does not allow for missing work to be calculated, so students are apt to skip over missing work because of their SBG grade; however, they could still have an incomplete at the end of the semester."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc943,NA,"I understand the gradebook set-up, the grades work for my science classes, but highlighting missing work would be ideal - students should be able to see at a glance that they are missing work."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc944,NA,"I think that most teachers, students, and parents are used to the traditional grading schematic - so, understanding how it works should be reiterated more often."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc945,NA,One major benefit is that students are able to have clear standards for learning objectives that iterate exactly what it takes to meet those standards - this is an excellent method for grading as it provides evidence of student achievement.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc946,NA,.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc947,NA,"The major problem with SBG is that it is very hard to hold students accountable for their grade.  If they do absolutely nothing, they still get 50% in the gradebook.  This means that students can put in very minimal effort, get 0s, 1s, and 2s on their assessments, and still pass with relative ease.  In my class, students need to complete all the practice assignments in order to be eligible for assessment re-takes, and often only 1-2 students are eligible and those students aren't the ones that need re-takes.  This is because A) the practice assignments have no value to them since they aren't for a grade, and B) they don't think they need to be eligible since they know they just need to get a 1 to keep their grade afloat."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc948,NA,SBG does not work for certain content areas.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc949,NA,"It does not apply well to areas of content like CTE where the student should learn how industry functions in real life; there is no way to ""redo"" projects in your actual job multiple times and not get fired for incompetence and it is bad practice to teach this habit to students."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc950,NA,N/A
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc951,NA,It allows students to redo work too many times and not rely on building skill over time to show their progress. It also reinforces bad work habits such as only doing a few of the tasks required to show mastery.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc952,NA,None.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc953,NA,It does not match up well with certain content.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc954,NA,Grading student works not just assessments.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc955,NA,"SBG is  great in theory.  However, I find that the new English curriculum Study Sync has overlapping standards that are difficult to break down and build into the SBG model.  If feels a lot like a square peg round hole situation."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc956,NA,"There were hours of work put into building around the SBG model for ELA but it seems like that is not being valued with the selection of this new curriculum which lends itself to a more traditional grading system. It is impossible to select a standard to focus the unit around when there are so many overlapping standards and the inability to isolate a standard.  Unit tests are not able to be modified by standard and are extremely long, seemingly for no reason."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc957,NA,"The gradebook seems a bit un-user friendly and complicated.  Admittedly, once you get the hang of it its not so bad."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc958,NA,If we are truly SBG students should be able to transition out of content courses for which they have shown mastery of standards.  It seems strange to me that a student can display mastery on a diagnostic yet still be held in the course.  There should be a true fluidity to courses once a student shows mastery.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc959,NA,I do like the aspect of trying to hold student's accountable for what they truly can demonstrate mastery on vs. grading thing thats are not impactful and do not measure mastery on a standard.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc960,NA,"It is NOT working since it's letting students obtain 50% on their graded assessments and, as a result, all students are passing with minimal effort."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc961,NA,N/A
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc962,NA,Inconsistencies districtwide and within sites.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc963,NA,I'm not clear; lack of statistical evidence nationwide
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc964,NA,With upper level math classes… topics are so intertwined that a test could have 8-9 standards on it. And to grade that is so unrealistic. Students not doing homework is a huge problem.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc965,NA,The classic version of synergy
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc966,NA,Students do not have maturity level to understand that practice (even not for grade) are what makes them successful on exams
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc967,NA,It does give a grade of what students know and not what they do
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc968,NA,"In many aspects, the process is more important than results."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc969,NA,Allow teachers to mark scores down (even by a half point) if work is late; several students (especially Freshman) will not submit work because there is no late penalty.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc970,NA,"SBG is working great in my classes, the only problem I have with SBG is that students do not have any incentives to turn in their practice work or their SLOs on time because there is no penalty for late work."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc971,NA,"Synergy just does not work!  It is constantly bogging down, causing issues or fails to load/save work.  It is unnecessarily complicated and you have to select each time what term you're grading for instead of it being automatic.  The codes are difficult and don't code correctly.  I shouldn't need to mark ""Mi"" then ""save"" and then put in a ""0"" for something to count as a zero.  The entire system is flawed and is a terrible gradebook system."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc972,NA,"Not having late penalties.  Implementation at certain levels; a ""1"" should not be put into the gradebook just because the student submits something it should still be graded as a ""0"" if there is no mastery shown."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc973,NA,"That a 4 is not perfect, I think it gives more opportunity for growth and celebrations for students."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc974,NA,"I do like aspects of SBG, such as how a student's grade is truly a reflection of learning. However, from a student's perspective, there is not a lot of buy-in for practice work as it is not for grade. Maybe there could be some sort of hybrid form of SBG? Maybe like a weighted gradebook - 15-20% practice work, the remaining 80-85% assessments graded using SBG? There would be more buy in from students as the practice could be the difference between an A or B, and a C or D."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc975,NA,The answer above sums this up.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc976,NA,"It can sometimes be challenging to navigate the gradebook in Synergy, that's all."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc977,NA,Answered above
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc978,NA,Answered above
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc979,NA,We need it for SBG it is not
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc980,NA,We had Nate and Phil give input on ours this summer and I think it is working better now. Except for the gradebook
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc981,NA,There is a second chance for the kids.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc982,NA,"I find that students will not do practice when there are no grades attached - then they get in a cycle of doing poorly on tests, retesting - over and over again.  Many of my students won't even take a test the first time it is given - they hand it back to me and say, ""I'll just retest.""  We are teaching them NOT to work and NOT to study.  If we keep SBG we need to do maybe an 80 % assessments / 20% practice work weighting, and put in MORE limits on retesting.  For example - you can retest on CFAs but not on unit tests or exams - that way students can build study skills over their 4 years of high school.  Right now - they just avoid work, even when given time in class, then wonder why they can't pass a test!  It is REALLY discouraging."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc983,NA,"Even in my AP classes - NO ONE does practice work (I have maybe 4 kids who consistently do it) - my grades in AP are mostly Cs and Ds - as a long time teacher I have NEVER seen that.  My kids won't do the reading, they won't take CFAs - and they can't pass an AP STYLE assessment - because they will not practice the skills they need.  My regular classes are in some ways worse - still no one does practice, many of them don't even retest when given an opportunity.  My AP kids are petrified to take the AP test - missing out on possible college credit, because they know they won't be prepared, because they are NOT willing to do the work that it takes to be truly successful in the class.  We are discouraging work.  Students don't study for assessments - because they rely on retesting - so I feel like teachers water down and simplify their tests - rigor goes out the window."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc984,NA,"In a content based course like AP classes - kids need to build vocabulary and understand the content - in order to do well on the essays where they will be asked to show some skill in crafting arguments / or using comparison etc.  When kids refuse to do the reading - and won't take vocab / main idea quizzes (CFAs), or do the practice that would help them build the knowledge they need to do well on summative assessments, they just end up doing poorly and loosing confidence in their own skills and knowledge."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc985,NA,"The gradebook is a MESS!  It is not user friendly - I'm not even sure if it is doing the math correctly when averaging my kids grades.    It would be nice to be able to type out messages to kids / parents - within the grades (as opposed to using ""canned"" comments). . . ."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc986,NA,Kids are discouraged from working and studying - so do not build good work habits or study skills.  For our college bound kiddos that could be a major problem.  It also discourages teachers from truly upping the bar and having high expectations.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc987,NA,"For the really bright kids who don't really need the practice it free's them up the time to do some enrichment - or to work on other things.  But this is a REALLY SMALL percentage of our students - and I feel that teachers could create a work around for this (if you are consistently acing summative assessments - you can skip some of the daily work) - 

I do not think that SBG is helping our lower level kids - they don't see a reason to do practice - and don't prepare for tests and their grades suffer as a result - then they get into this cycle of testing, retesting, where they get behind on current material!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc988,NA,"I feel like consistency is important - and it needs to be K-12 so students build an academic attitude.  If they have been working for points K-8 - and we say oh, no points for daily work - they will think it means you don't have to do it.  If we want to stick with SBG then it should be district wide."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc989,NA,I would give a percentage to practice work and CFAs. With 100% of the points for SLOs the students have zero incentive to do the practice and it is the practice that will prepare them for the SLO. Instead when I give SLOs students are not prepared and the first thing they ask is when can they retake the SLO. I would recommend at least an 80/20 with 20% of the grade in practice/CFA and 80% for SLO; even more I would like a 70/30 split.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc990,NA,"SBG has really made me think about the work I am asking students to do. I am considering the standard and what the students need to show mastery of that standard more than I ever have in my 11 years of classroom work. However, the student's idea that if it isn't a SLO it does not matter makes it difficult to really know if the student is truly mastering the subject or just being tenacious in retakes."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc991,NA,"I would like to see work done on our specific standards. Our standards lean more toward English standards than Government/Social Studies standards. I would like to see standards rounded out more, with a mix of the research and actual civics standards."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc992,NA,This is my first year with this gradebook. I would defer to those that have been using it longer.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc993,NA,100% of the grade being for SLOs
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc994,NA,My rethinking of how and what I am teaching.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc995,NA,Accountability. Weighted standards. Homework students will attempt. Assessment data to compare classes and assess best practices.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc996,NA,"The class is chunked up so small, the students are not learning long term. They are also not caring their tests as much now, because many care only about passing and doing no work gets a 50%. I've had a couple students not do any work since beginning of September. They only need to get another 1 or 2 and they'll pass the class. Students  have learned the system. At the end of this semester, I will have had students learn only a handful of standards, but somehow pass the class with a score over 60%."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc997,NA,Standards should not be equally weighted.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc998,NA,I look at students grades and I have no idea how their grades are calculated or what I am looking at. This is coming from someone that has used SBG for last three years. I have talked to parents and students and they are lost.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1013,NA,"Should be department decisions, some content may not benefit from SBG as much as others."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1014,NA,"It creates an environment where students are not motivated to work. We keep talking about the philosophy behind SBG which is great but expecting our below grade level kids to do hours of homework for no grade because it's ""good for them"" is not working. Our students need more structure. They aren't there yet. There should be an emphasis on being able to produce work and dissect large amounts of information to be college and career ready."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1015,NA,our gradebook does a terrible job communicating SBG information to students
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1016,NA,It's different in every class and at every site-- not guaranteed and viable curriculum. it was supposed to solve a problem with students having more ownership over their learning-- that is not happening-- it has not improved achievement by any measureable indicator.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1017,NA,it doesn't work in all classes please just trust teachers to know what works
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1018,NA,Have the work completed upfront so that teachers aren't heading into this blindfolded.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1019,NA,homework carries no weight.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1020,NA,"Some content that have general answers work great. Math and science is very black and white with answers, and therefore does not work with this format."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1021,NA,"The standards are all over the place, and are very confusing because all sites' standards are visible. Either one uniform set for all sites or make it so standards are labeled site-specific."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1022,NA,"Like most things bureaucratic, what is a good idea in a select concept/subject is assumed to work for all subjects, and becomes implemented en masse, even in subjects where it only minorly works. Not everything needs or should be graded with a rubric."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1023,NA,"For subject that are subjective, ie English, Languages, Art, etc., where assessments can be subjective, SBG shines."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1024,NA,"Once again, language arts, art, project-based lessons will definitely benefit from this. However, science and math, which tend to have direct and non-subjective answers, do not."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1025,NA,Shorten the time window to re-assess
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1026,NA,Many students only participate when it is for a grade.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1032,NA,It takes too long to enter grades.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1035,NA,Choice is important.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1036,NA,Go back to a hybrid model
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1037,NA,"Students are passing that should not be because they do not to any work in class, but can score a 1 on an assessment.  Students are not motivated to do their class work because they do not receive points for it.  Hardly any students take advantage of re-taking and assessment for a better grade.  In addition, I do not feel that SBG is preparing out students to be College and Career Ready!!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1038,NA,"Assessments must be entered 2 times to appear on a progress report.  Only the scores imputed on the assignment side show up on a progress report or a printed grade sheet.

Also- Scores do not average correctly."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1041,NA,"If some of us are required to use it, all class should be required to do the same."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1042,NA,We have to make classwork/homework mean something. Students know and will only try on SLO's. a zero is not worth 50% . if you can score high on a few tests then you do not have to do a few and will still have a decent grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1043,NA,Same as above

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1047,NA,It is very inconsistent.  Students are also learning bad habit of asking what is practice and what counts knowing they can re-assess if needed.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1048,NA,We have no idea how our grades are calculated.  They say don't use percentages but then it is converted to a percentage for grading.  Can't even have a conversation with parents because we don't exactly know and get different answers from cite or district.

Currently I have a student with 25 missing assignments, does not have understanding of the content, yet is still passing the class with a 60%. It is not a true measure of student's learning and creates laziness which then becomes a distraction in class disrupting students who are in class to learn. In each class there are about 60% with this same mentality and lack of motivation."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1066,NA,Some content areas or classes...AP will not work with SBG.  It Sets them up for failur.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1067,NA,"I do not have an issue with the concept of SBG, as I think we should teach the standards and should not grade busywork, but we should also acknowledge that a one-size fits all approach is not the best approach.  John Dewey wrote that in education, learning and experience are not just black and white, and we should apply that to grading as well.  I do not agree with tradition for the sake of tradition, but there are some advantages of the traditional gradebook in the context of a music classroom that SBG does not work with.

Example - We have 11 national standards and only 3 of them are performance.  When I write my gradebook I am then constantly assessing the same 3 standards and the grades get overwritten.  

Example - A student misses the major summative assessment - championships, where the marching band performs their final performance of the year, putting everything that they have learned to the test.  This is usually 300+ hours of work.  A student gets a missing for the grade, which is 50%.  Their grade goes down maybe 8%.  Traditional gradebooks would have this students grade impacted significantly heavier.  This is also what we would see in college.  When I was in college, if I missed a single rehearsal then my grade went down 20%.  If I missed a performance then it went down to an F.  No questions asked.  What are we truly teaching our kids if they are not learning that their behaviors have consequences.  I acknowledge that we must also be aware of our hidden curriculum, but we should be preparing students for life after high school too."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1083,NA,more detailed in how students are earning their grade. Very transparent.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1084,NA,"If keeping, modify it so that practices and CFAs count towards part of the grade-the kids know they don't count so they just don't do them. SBG the way that we do it has made them EXTREMELY lazy rather than accountable. First question I always get asked is ""Does this count for a grade?"". They also want to do retakes without actually studying or doing the missing practice. Having only the tests count, the kids that work their tails off and do well in class participation but bomb the test are really struggling as well."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1085,NA,"Kids are extremely lazy and do not participate in practice work. As a foreign language, it is essential that they practice pronunciation and written work, but they refuse because it doesn't count for a grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1086,NA,"The gradebook for Spanish should be averaged for each SLO per standard, rather than last SLO taken-the standards are so general that it really isn't a linear process."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1087,NA,"SLOs are the only things that matter, kids can retake any SLO anytime without any responsibility of deadlines (our SLO project only about 1/3 of my class turned in on time because they knew they could turn it in late)"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1088,NA,"Students get a second chance, which is a good thing, but the way it currently is it is just out of control. It also makes grading easier due to less assignments in the gradebook (minus the endless amount of retakes and late work)"

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1095,NA,"When given the time to reassess, it gives students another chance to show knowledge, but opportunities to reassess and test are often canceled or rearranged.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1099,NA,"Late work restrictions, CFA's and practice work for an actual grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1100,NA,Student's know that practice work and CFA's do not count for grade so they have no desire to complete anything. They are also aware that they can retake any SLO at any time and this also does not give the students any motivation to get their practice work done.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1101,NA,"I am not sure if all grades are being weighted into the overall grade because sometimes when I input a grade, nothing happens to the overall grade"

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1104,NA,"1.  SBG is not helpful to the middle to lowest students - they tend to give up because they NEVER will reach the standard and don't understand why.  One assessment that is writing or and or reading based (their biggest struggle areas) is high stakes EVERY time.  
2. Question asked EVERY time:  ""IS this for a grade?"" - ((no)) - then I am not going to do it.  AND along with NOT doing the work - become the biggest and easiest distraction to others who decide it's not important or WORTH doing."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1113,NA,This is a lot harder for singletons to implement
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1114,NA,There is no accountability piece for students. They can be absent and miss every test and assessment the entire year and take the last 2 tests and score just well enough to pass the school year.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1115,NA,The grade scale makes it easy to pass students when they are not ready.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1116,NA,The major problem is this is not getting the students college and career ready. Colleges and careers do not use an SBG philosophy. When they make it to college they are exposed to hard grading practices that we should have prepared them for.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1117,NA,Less grading
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1118,NA,The courses that use the same standard multiple times should use but courses where certain standards are used on a limited basis should not use it. For example world history.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1123,NA,SLO's are the only items in the gradebook. No fluff. Just like college!
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1124,NA,"Go back to the roots, so actually get as far away from hybrid as possible. The big problem (read complaints) about SBG is that teachers still do not understand the concept. I see teachers just use the 4-point scale mathematically, so a 60% is a 1, instead of evaluating the work and deciding if it Minimally Proficient or Partially or whatever. The big problem is this takes work and brain power that teachers are not motivated to spend. This motivation will only come with proper training and direction FROM LEADERSHIP, above, not below. If we are going to be left to our own devices then let us be on our own and do not impose rules that you are not willing to fully support. SBG is a philosophical change in grading, it is NOT simply using a 4-point scale instead of a percentage. If all the District is pushing for is a 4-point scale then I say go back to traditional. We need more training on the WHY, not the how."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1125,NA,I have to answer questions about why other teachers grade how they do (straight up mathematical conversion from percentage to 4-point).
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1126,NA,"It works because again, it is not about the grade, it is about proficiency. The fact that this is even a question shows we need to go back to training on the fundamentals of SBG and the WHY we chose to do it in the first place."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1127,NA,"Synergy is not designed for SBG, and the parts that are are restricted by District, again due to a lack of understanding. Some issues are having to use Last Grade or Average only, or having to jump through hoops to get standards loaded, and the standards do not tier."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1128,NA,"SBG, when done correctly, can be great. Our implementation is, to use a military term, half-assed. There is no real commitment due to a lack of support from District. One way District can show support is by dropping the conversion scale from percentage to 4-point and use only 4 point scale. Another problem this conversion creates is the assumption a 4 is a perfect score since it converts to 100%. Many teachers do not assign 4s when the student is clearly highly proficient."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1129,NA,"It is easier and faster to grade/assess student work, as long as the teacher has a clear understanding on the proficiency levels and what they want the students to learn."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1130,NA,"It's a maybe. Honestly we are constrained by limitations in Synergy. If Synergy is capable of allowing some classes to grade using SBG and others traditional, then let school(site) PLCs decide what to use. If not, then I think traditional is better and teachers that understand SBG can just use a traditional gradebook (100=4=HP, 70=C=P, and so on). Again, the main point is SBG is NOT about a gradebook, it's about GRADING.      Good luck!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1131,NA,I would like to see us get a grade book that goes away from percentages and goes more towards a mode-style SBG gradebook.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1132,NA,I LOVE SBG!  I like how I can personalize the learning needs of every student and only have them repeat the material that they need to.  I would not get rid of it for anything.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1133,NA,"As mentioned above, I would like to see the numbers (1-4) disassociated with percentages, and more of mode or average based SBG grading system."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1134,NA,Students not studying for the test the first time and/or not doing the practice work
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1135,NA,"It personalizes education to each student, as it should be.  Not every student needs to do as much practice and it puts the onus of learning on the student, where it should be."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1136,NA,The biggest problem I have with SBG is that students that do almost nothing can still get a D fairly easily and pass the class.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1137,NA,See above.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1138,NA,N/A
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1139,NA,It doesn't include any mode for accountability.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1140,NA,We need to have accountability for practice work
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1141,NA,SBG - only allows grading assessments and students need to have some kind of grade for all the practice they do before the assessment.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1142,NA,I actually don't know what will make the gradebook better.  I believe the standards need to be there but they are not.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1143,NA,It doesn't take into account practice and the accountability with goes with it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1144,NA,"Actually know if the students is learning the material, since the majority of the grade comes from assessments"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1145,NA,"No percentages applied to it in the gradebook.  SBG should just be 1, 2, 3, 4.  decimal places for averaging is fine."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1146,NA,Percentages are inflating grades to seem as if the students are at a proficient level when they are not.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1147,NA,"same as above, percentages should not be used to calculate the grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1148,NA,none
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1149,NA,"students can see exactly what a 1, 2, 3, 4 means.  There is no gap created by a 0 when they earn a 0.  Practice should not affect overall grade but mastery does."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1150,NA,"There needs to be a way to hold students accountable for all of the work we do in class, not just SLOs. There also needs to be a way for students who struggle to find opportunities to be successful, which can be very challenging in SBG. Many of my lower students feel defeated before they even begin and then cannot be convinced to try."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1151,NA,"It is incredibly difficult to motivate students to complete work. In general, many of them will not complete classroom tasks unless they are an SLO grade. Every task given is met with ""Is this a SLO?"" and if the answer is no, they opt to not complete the task. There are too many students who choose to do this to fight them on it. Further, students who struggle feel defeated because they feel there is nothing they can do to be successful, even with accommodations or modifications as necessary."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1152,NA,I feel like I explained this in my previous statement.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1153,NA,"Sometimes teacher view and student view do not line up accurately so students struggle to know where they stand. Grades show for practice assignments and CFAs but not for SLOs for some reason, despite being the only thing impacting their grades."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1154,NA,"Students are highly unmotivated to do work not tied to an SLO, reducing their opportunities to improve. Students do not feel rushed to complete SLOs...often turning in work extremely late, which impacts my experience and time management as a teacher."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1155,NA,"You know where students are progressing within the standards, and areas they need to improve upon."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1156,NA,"I believe that there are inherent problems with any grading system that seeks to rank students.  SBG tries to create a system of grading that is more accurate with respect to academic performance, but fails to recognize effort and other attributes that may be part of the education process.  As it sits, SBG works if only a few grades are calculated--if a teacher has several ""for grade"" assessments, the grade book becomes ""watered down"" and the grade becomes less accurate as the educator tries to evaluate more skills.  The solution may be in an 8 point or 9 point rubric or creating more grades like for each content area.  Ultimately, SBG has faults in that it reduces effort at the end of the grading period and asks teachers to hyper focus on particular skills rather than broaden to more authentic learning tasks that require multiple skills.  For me, it also creates a situation for students who consistently score at a ""1"" or a ""2"" in that it is difficult with such wide grading bands to see progress, and students who are sensitive to ""self-efficacy"" principles give up.

The old system had its flaws with regard to equity, so in that way, SBG is a better alternative for a district that wants uniformity.  Having said that, my perception is that SBG focuses the teacher and student on parts rather than the whole of the education target.

The strength of SBG is that it allows teachers to grade quickly.  Essentially, most students fall between a 2 and a 3 or a 3 and a 4.  But this also gives little feedback to students.  SBG works best when a teacher has multiple opportunities to conference with students one-on-one, however, with the demands of most course content, this seems unlikely."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1157,NA,"Students lose incentive.  The rubrics must be broad to incorporate all skills on a 4 point scale.  I feel as if a 8 or 9 point rubric could help here--however, this would not solve the problem of focus on minute skills.  There might be room to create more holistic rubrics with multiple standards to address this weakness in the current SBG situation."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1158,NA,"Again, the 4 point rubric is too broad for quality feedback. Most students are okay if they are consistently earning a 2 or a 3 or a 4.  Because of the difficulty of moving from one grade category to the next, students give up too easily.  Essentially they tell themselves there is no point.  At the end of a course, it is near impossible to move a grade--particularly when a 1 in the grade book on even a few assignments keeps a student from failing.  If a students is not motivated by a grade, doing one or two assignments keeps them earning credit but not focused on class."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1159,NA,"I would like to see either more holistic rubrics that score multiple SLOs that are then calculated in the gradebook holistically, or a 8 or 9 point rubric.  Teachers will work within the parameters the current grading system.  The gradebook is not the problem."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1160,NA,"Major problems:

watered down grades
reduces effort
self-efficacy creates a situation where students give up
lack of quality feedback given the broad categories of a four-point scale
Students and teachers both can easily categorize themselves onto a 4 point scale--and it is difficult to move more than one level up (from a 1 to a 3, for example.)"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1161,NA,"Accurately groups students in 4 categories of minimally proficient, partially proficient, proficient, and highly proficient.  I would argue, however, that this is a fairly easy task for most educators and students probably could group themselves."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1162,NA,"I think equity is important, but unless it is working, I wouldn't demand teachers use it."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1163,NA,The only problem is with alignment of standards and learning targets. The actual SBG grade book function within synergy is really unpleasant to use.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1164,NA,Focus on student achievement rather than attendance/participation
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1165,NA,The grades seem to be fairly even among my class. There is a mix of grades.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1166,NA,It just isn't user friendly...I'm not sure how to make it better.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1167,NA,Hard for grading a test when there are many different standards contained.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1168,NA,Grading for their knowledge not completion
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1169,NA,I'm not even using it and students are asking me to retake tests.  Can you imagine that?  We are supposed to get these kids college and career ready and we let them retake tests?  Why bother studying for the first one?  Just bomb it and retake it.  It's insane.  And getting students to turn things in was hard enough before; now add sbg.... It's insanity.  The entire program is the most ludicrous thing I've seen in my 13 years in public education.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1170,NA,"I have students in my AP Classes who have other SBG classes and it's not doing them any favors.  No stress, no time limits, no studying or cramming....It's literally killing them.  Maybe the teachers are doing it wrong but I see these students lacking fundamental skills that are necessary to succeed later."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1171,NA,Keep it normal.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1172,NA,"See above, I have to get to my students :)"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1173,NA,"For the students?  No stress.  No deadlines.  No expectations.  Easy.  If I was a teen, I'd love it.  Well, except I just had an AP student tell me he hates it because he doesn't understand what he has to do to get an A.  He has an 87 but a 3.0 and drives him crazy.  So that's a negative and doesn't answer the question but I thought you'd want both sides."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1174,NA,"I'm a pretty good teacher.  I know, all teachers say that, but it's true.  I demand rigor and accountability in my students and myself.  This does not help me do that.  You're making my job harder when you should be making it easier by allowing experts do their job.  I can succeed if you'll just let me.  Please let me succeed.  Thanks guys, good luck.  Oh, if it's any consolation, no one knows what SBG is, no one knows how to implement it correctly because there apparently is no correct way; its philosophy.  So if you decide to mandate it, you're just gonna get confusion."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1175,NA,"We need to raise the threshold for passing in some way, we also need more resources and training on how to use it correctly."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1176,NA,"Students can pass by doing very little. They know it. I agree with the ""unfair 0"" but I give out many unfair grades to student who aren't earning them. If you just do the tests and get a 1.5...you pass the class. That makes no sense to me."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1177,NA,The gradebook is fine. I wish there was a way to have things automatically marked for retakes so the students see it like a missing assignment.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1178,NA,Answered above.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1179,NA,I think it is more growth minded when done right.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1180,NA,"The SBG approach for SLOs is good, because it allows students to retake a test/SLO if they don't do well. However, I believe it is important that we modify SBG to make practice work 20% of their grade. This allows students to be held accountable to doing their work, but it also provides them the understanding and opportunity to help build a work ethic, and understand that everything has its importance."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1181,NA,"SBG is not working in my course because there is zero incentive for students to do anything but their SLOs, and even then, there is no sense or urgency to complete them, because they know they can reassess at any point, or turn things in a week or two late without any repercussions. SBG as we have it structured right now, does NOT prepare students for college or a career because it does not help students create a work ethic for themselves, nor does it help them learn time management skills. I believe making the practice work and CFAs count toward their grade will be a big help."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1182,NA,"I believe the assignments view works great for students and teachers in the gradebook. It is easy to navigate and easy to find any missing assignments. However, when looking at the standards view, students have a difficult time understanding what they have done and what is missing."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1183,NA,"As SBG is currently structured, the major problems with SBG are the lack of accountability in doing all of their work and on time. Allows for students to not care about the practice work or CFAs if they believe they'll do well on the SLO. Not a realistic approach to help students prepare for college and career opportunities. Hinders students from creating and building a successful work ethic and time management skills, and it inaccurately inflates student GPAs. As SBG is structured right now, it essentially is 'No Child Left Behind', if 'No Child Left Behind' simply meant making sure they have a passing grade so they don't get held back. We can modify SBG to make it work well, and I believe that would be to include practice work and CFAs as part of their grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1184,NA,"The big benefit right now with SBG is that they are able to retake something if they do not do well. However, I truly believe SBG needs to be modified."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1185,NA,"I believe that SBG is not a good fit for CTE courses as it currently is, because it is crucial for college and career preparedness that students understand what a good work ethic is, and that when they are in their careers/business world, there are a lot of little things that go into jobs that you can't just skip over because it isn't the main thing. ""How we do one thing is how we do everything."""
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1186,NA,I like being able to do hybrid! It helps with student motivation to put in other big assignments for grading besides just assessments.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1200,NA,When I taught Spanish it was very difficult to get students to do (attempt) the practice assignments. With art I can find standards for practice work as well as assessments. Students do better on their assessments because they know that the practices are attached to standards also. Students actually complete their practices and try to do their best on them because they count as a grade. If I ever teach Spanish again I would try to find standards for practices also.

There is a huge lack of clarity and understanding and if the students who are supposed to be learning don't understand their grades, then we shouldn't do things this way. It is also very hard to explain things to parents. They simply don't understand what a standard is, what 1, 2, 3, 4 mean, why grades are tied to standards, etc. 

SBG also is far far too forgiving and promotes laziness and complacency among students. Students are well aware that there are no late penalties and that everything can be retaken. There is a culture of retakes at our schools. Students will not try very hard on the first attempt because they know they can just retake it. There are no consequences. Students don't work as hard on completing things in class because they know that only assessments are graded. SBG makes it almost impossible to fail a course even while giving minimal effort. I do not believe good work habits are being created by this system. Students are being taught that they can turn in everything late and redo everything, which generally isn't how life works. 

The ""Full SBG"" Grade book is quite simply atrocious. It is not fair, confusing, and a disaster. It makes each individual grade worth FAR too much because each grade erases each other grade within a standard. Each assessment ends up being worth like 1/5 of a grade. Should a student be punished incredibly harshly for one poor assessment, even if they were just off that day? My students will experience 7-10% swings in their grades with one new assessment. Then, when trying to explain why this is happening, parents and students once again do not understand that grades are tied to standards and that each standard is it's own grade. It is too confusing for students and parents and does not help them.

Good teaching is still good teaching. You can still use clear learning targets and rubrics without SBG."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1246,NA,"SBG seems to be mostly for skills based classes. You can test for a skill and put it on a rubric. However for multiple choice type tests where students need to know content, it is not as good. You just end up making a scale and it is somewhat clunky."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1247,NA,"The full SBG gradebook should be completely scrapped. It is a disaster plain and simple. I have never had a worse experience grading. It is unfair, punishing, and worst of all EXTREMELY CONFUSING. Students don't understand it whatsoever and parents don't understand it. What is the point of a grading system if the PEOPLE WE ARE EDUCATING AND THEIR PARENTS do not understand how it works. It must be scrapped."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1249,NA,I don't really see any benefit over a traditional gradebook with good teaching practices.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1250,NA,There is no one size fits all approach to grading/gradebook/assessment/etc. There are so many different types of courses in our district and it would be foolish to mandate every one of them do things in the same way.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1251,NA,I like this latest system of domains- it is much more user friendly for CTE. I feel like too much work has gone into SBG to go back to traditional. The biggest hang up is getting synergy to work.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1252,NA,"The previous model used last year was not effective. It also hurt that we didn't get to write our own SLO's and standards. This year we were able to, and it was much more effective."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1253,NA,"It is very time consuming to enter grades with this new system, and it was hard to set up. Now that we have used it more, it was easier"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1254,NA,"We still need to be able to give out zeros and have them appear in the gradebook. Students use the gradebook as their guide on their progress. If an assignment/SLO doesn't impact their grade, they do not care. I also dislike the no deadlines belief. This is not conducive to real world application."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1255,NA,"Less grading, more accountability with Rubrics, clear grading system. Goal is proficiency versus a grade"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1256,NA,"Remove the 4 point systems.  Students can show they understand it at different levels. For us to assign a 4, 3, 2, or 1 and have it translated to 100 % or 88% implies there is not in between levels of understanding."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1257,NA,"My motivated honor's student's do not like how they have to be perfect or get a B.  I normally just give grades on tests and labs and that works well to assess standards, but at a more fair level than SBG."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1258,NA,Fix the issues before we use it. I have student's whose grades do not follow with what should be happening. I explained it and asked for help a couple of months ago and it still hasn't been figured out.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1259,NA,"It isn't applicable to students going to college. Students who care about their grades, have increased anxiety due to it being harder to do well (either 100%  or a B)"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1260,NA,"Assessing students on standards only and not fluff work, which I did prior to implementing the 4 point grading system."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1261,NA,It's difficult for students to keep up. We are ONE district and should be doing the same type of grading as well as teaching the same standards; aka Verrado has their own way of using SBG gradebook by using SEP rather than standards.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1262,NA,"it needs to be streamlined so that the performance standards are truly from the state standards.  We are allowing teachers to come up with SLO's and using those as titles of assignments, as opposed to a title of the assessment and embedding them under a standard.  We also need to be able to assess the promptness of assignments.  Students should NOT be able to do all of the work in a couple weeks and get credit for the entire semester.  there needs to be timelines and expirations on makeuup/redo's."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1263,NA,"the gradebook sucks, and not being able to assess works standards (late submissions) makes it tough, especially with AP/IB classes.  it is a life skill, you need to go to school and be on time."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1264,NA,"I don't think one size fits all.  for our distrcit, we have school using different ""standards"" so we aren't even on the same page as what to assess."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1265,NA,more user friendly when creating assignments...too many tabs to click on to create one assignment.  I do like that you can see the standards and the assessments are embedded beneath it
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1266,NA,"not all teachers are doing it, and those that are are all implementing it differently.  The kids have no idea how to check their grades because everyone is doing somethingk different"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1267,NA,the ease of reassessments on exactly what the kids are missing
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1268,NA,some elective courses may not have standards in place
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1269,NA,EOCA's are redundant as you are retesting standards and applying another grade for them
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1270,NA,"I taught using SBG before moving to AFO. Allowing students to retest gave them the opportunity to learn (or relearn) the material. Before allowing retests, students would not go back and relearn a concept on which they did poorly. Testing with SBG became more quizlike as the tests were designed specifically for each standard - no big unit tests."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1271,NA,?
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1272,NA,Lack of willingness / fear of change for teachers.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1273,NA,"Actually assessing the students on the standards, not on completion of homework which could be copied or fluffy projects that may or may not demonstrate knowledge."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1274,NA,Students are not doing their homework and therefore not able to take tests.  They are being complacent and not worrying about doing the work to understand.  Kids get a 50% and figure that they can easily do something for a D but do not understand the content.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1275,NA,It doesn't work for CTE in the slightest.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1276,NA,I don't need any changes except getting rid of SBG altogether
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1277,NA,Students don't do the work they need to do to learn.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1278,NA,There aren't any at this point coming
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1279,NA,CTE does not fit into this mold.  They are a different animal altogether and shoud be treated as such.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1280,NA,My class is career and lab based and the grading needs to reflect more than just the one standard. It also people who don't contribute the group fully to get higher grades than desevred.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1281,NA,Our classes and very cross standard and it becomes difficult to zero in on one task when there are so many levels to each lab. It also makes it more difficult. Many items barely effect a grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1282,NA,Every standard adds 2 columns minimum and they are in order by standard number and not by date make it hard to follow and find.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1283,NA,There is 0 accountability for the students. It does not align with making students college ready and allows students to choose not to do work
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1284,NA,Nothing
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1285,NA,Teachers need to have the right to grade as we feel fit for our content. SBG makes many teachers feel that we are simply making it as easy as possible for students to pass a class vs challenging them and requiring them to learn.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1286,NA,"Allow more flexibility. Don't require it for every course. Some courses, such as AP courses, should not be required to use SBG as these courses are meant to prepare students for a college setting and SBG will not be found in a college classroom."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1287,NA,"I believe it is working for my course in the way it provides an accurate representation of what my students know. It has allowed all my PLC team members to stay on the same page and has made our gradebooks essentially identical. Where SBG causes issues is where it is misaligned with our new math curriculum and with preparing our students for the ACT. SBG grading makes it hard to assess multiple standards at once. The McGraw Hill Curriculum integrates multiple standards throughout, and the ACT requires students to integrate multiple skills into solving a solving problem."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1288,NA,See answer from above.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1289,NA,"After trying the SBG gradebook for the first couple weeks of the semester, my team and I abandoned it for the traditional gradebook setting. The extra clicking and settings required to enter grades in standards mode caused too many hiccups and caused a number of gradebook errors. I'd like to see an SBG gradebook that functions more like the Classic gradebook. There was major confusion over the Assignments setting and the Standards setting. I don't believe the SBG gradebook setting is any better at communicating what a student knows."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1290,NA,"A student can pass a course after demonstrating very little actual knowledge. Depending on how many graded assessments factor into the a student's grade, if a student does well on one test, and then poorly on most other tests, they are still within range of passing. SBG also devalues studying and practice because everything can be re-taken."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1291,NA,"It is a less punitive grading system. Students can re-assess to show that they've gained the knowledge, even when they didn't get it the first time. It keeps students within 10% of passing at minimum, so basically it's always possible to pass and students will not give up. It also focuses teachers to write tests that directly align to standards based on rubrics."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1292,NA,"I don't believe SBG works as a one-size-fits-all approach. I prefer that we hold to common grading practices campus-wide (and perhaps district-wide), but we should allow flexibility across courses and departments."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1293,NA,Not accept late work or make a stiffer penalty. There really is no consequence for turning in assignments late which I don't think helps kids be career and college ready.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1294,NA,I love giving students the option to retest or redo work. Great concept.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1295,NA,Mean vs. Most Recent score. The grade should be based on the average. Most recent doesn't work because in CTE we constantly evaluate the same standards.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1296,NA,Listed above.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1297,NA,Students can essentially pick their own grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1298,NA,It artificially inflates or deflates student grades.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1299,NA,"If we are required to give students a 2 (for example) when a grade is a 87%, it will not work."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1300,NA,"50% being the lowest grade (versus 40%), being required by admin to artificially lower scores unless students perform at the next level (2, 3, 4), it passes students who don't know the material and prevents many students from receiving As when they would otherwise."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1301,NA,I don't.  This has been a disaster.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1302,NA,"I do think that we should be consistent, but continung to restrict teacher abilities does not work.  Think about it.  The reason that SBG is a fad now is that someone was ALLOWED to think outside of the box."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1303,NA,"have weights for tests/assignments, but still use a 0-4 point scale"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1304,NA,"students take advantage (in a negative way) of retakes, even with requirements"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1305,NA,Algebra 2 has a lot of different standards/sub objectives that don't necessarily carry out through the year
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1306,NA,I like that you can categorize it by unit
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1307,NA,I am not sure if the philosophies of SBG are college & career ready
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1308,NA,cohesive grading among all classes/subjects
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1309,NA,N/A
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1310,NA,"SBG is not suitable for all departments. Lifeskills does not benefit from SBG. In addition, it has a negative effect on the students because it does not prepare students to be college ready. Colleges are not using Standards Base Grading, nor are they giving the students the opportunity to retake tests unlimited amount of times, and colleges accept homework as a grade. I do not support SBG."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1311,NA,"SBG only works with things that are truly progressive learning. I have 2 classes, Math and an elective, and they both give students a faulty sense of how they are doing in class. Some standards take longer, and require more work, and can have multiple things going in the gradebook, yet be the same as a different standard that took a week to learn. There are also certain classes, where participation does matter, but they do not have a standard for that, again giving a false sense of how the student is doing in class."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1312,NA,"It is quite complicated, and takes far too long for things to load. It is very difficult for students to view and understand their grades."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1313,NA,"It is not conducive to being ready for college, though we claim that it is. In college a teacher is not going to care if you just do good overall on a standard, they will care and grade each of the things they tell you to turn in. The way it is currently set up, is just getting students in the habit of thinking the only thing that matters is a test, which is only the case sometimes."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1314,NA,Does get rid of the fluff. But we can require that there aren't added things that don't relate to the class easily.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1315,NA,"Certain departments may be able to do it easily. But it's not conducive to every class. If we are to do it in every class, there needs to be guides on how it would actually work in each class."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1316,NA,"I'm not participating in it.  Synergy was a mess for the first month of school.  Initially my content PLC was going to do SBG, but due to the logistical issues with the grade book and SBG being implemented differently across the district and even within our school, it felt like the best thing would be to stay with traditional until all the bugs can be worked out."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1317,NA,"There can not be ""my version of SBG"" from teacher to teacher."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1318,NA,"NA"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1319,NA,Many have their own ideas on what SBG is or are creating Hybrid SBG accounts.  Gradebook was a mess
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1320,NA,If it is determined that specific classes are not SBG compatible then exceptions should be made.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1321,NA,Use SBG model for assessments only perhaps. It isn't realistic to prepare students for college and careers using a system that sets them up for failure in a on-demand results driven world.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1322,NA,"Social Studies, while it does have skills to develop, is a dominantly content related field. SS teachers are in a bind using the SBG format."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1323,NA,"Because not all skills are as pertinent to each unit in Social Studies courses, students do not get regular practice on all skills. Units cannot be made to focus on a single skillset, nor can assessments, making it an overwhelming undertaking for student and staff alike to ensure that each skill is continuously developing and being assessed while ALSO ensuring the necessary content knowledge is being built. If the content isn't learned, it is exponentially harder to demonstrate mastery in a skill, regardless of the students ability in said skill."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1324,NA,Social Studies & Elective Standards working from day 1.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1325,NA,"It does not prepare students for success in the real world. Retakes, late work, and sub-par performance are not forgiven in college or career. While I personally believe in these methods, they are not realistic for preparing students for society."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1326,NA,"They close the gap between students who fail and those who achieve, making upwards mobility easier (I'd say, too easy.)"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1327,NA,"Social studies is a content focus, with skills to support. Students need the content to practice the skills, and therefore the focus should be on the content first."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1328,NA,"I do like that standards based grading allows the student to know what they are being graded on, but it is also very time consuming. As we assign and grade in Google Classroom, but enter our grades in synergy, entering grades is time consuming. Google classroom allows syncing of grades, but it does not work with standards based grading.
   I believe that Google Classroom rubrics should be standards based, in that they show the standards they are being graded on and have points assigned in each standard, but the overall grade should be an aggregate of those scores and not have a grade for each that has to be individually entered for each standard."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1329,NA,"If a class is working on a single standard at a time, then it makes sense to grade that standard."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1330,NA,The current grade system is not user friendly to the common user. it requires a lot of programming and configuration. It easy easy to make mistake and hard to correct them.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1331,NA,"The system is time consuming and can also be difficult for students. As some standards may only be used once or have one assignment, a bad mark on one assignment can affect an entire grade. On the teacher end, the grades take longer to enter and it also requires a teacher to go back multiple times to fix a resubmitted assignment. It makes syncing from Google Classroom impossible, whereas standard grading would automatically sync. The grade calculation method is also challenging. Students are often confused how their grade is calculated. Finally, as only assessments are grading, many student have caught on and will not do their normal work."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1332,NA,Standards based grading allows students to know what they are specifically being graded on. It also takes the burden off teachers to grade practice and eliminates some busy work.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1333,NA,"My class is project based. Many projects include multiple standards and the expectation increases as the students learn. By year's end a project could have as many as 8 standards(focus, editing, composition, file handling, intended effect, camera controls, presentation, etc.) That would mean that in order to properly grade and provide feedback , each assignment would have many grades. The time commitment to enter that many grades in the gradebook is burdensome. I believe that project based classes should be exempt."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1334,NA,"Math:  is a step process, along with point totals for showing their work and procedures.  Students should be given points based on their progress through the question, rather than an overall 4 point scale.  If you are going to do a 4.0 scale, then do it as they do in the colleges, where there are actually decimal values after each, and 50% should not be a consideration with them doing NOTHING."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1335,NA,"I have never heard that 50% is where everyone starts out, for doing nothing.  You earn your grade, and if you have a bad quiz or test, doesn't mean that you go back and change all the current tests/quizzes to the current grade.  I have never heard of that either."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1349,NA,Students literally do nothing in class because they have eternity to make up the assignments. This creates even more angst when you have a sub because students will not work even if there is a lesson plan in place. It is not preparing the students for post secondary plans.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1350,NA,"Again, my assignments are project based so students choose to not do assignments in a timely manner and then they need a complete reteach not based off of not knowing the content but plainly because they didn't want to participate that day."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1375,NA,SBG was implemented way too quick without any of the necessary support in place. Without proper rubrics for EVERYTHING in place it just falls apart. The 50% as the lowest is also way too high as it makes it too easy for students who truly don't understand the content to pass if they only get a small percentage. There is also no impetus for students to turn in their work as they know there is no late penalty. In 10 years of teaching I have never had such a low level of engagement as when I have done SBG.

First and foremost, parents and students do not understand the grade book.  It is too confusing and convoluted. SBG tends to lead to inflated grades and if we continue using ""most recent evidence"" it is too easy for students to do the minimum amount of work and earn a passing grade. And because everything is graded out of 4 points, assignments are all equal in a sense.  I cannot make a major exam or project worth more than a short in class assignment.  I know that many would argue that averages are not accurate, and perhaps for subject areas like math that is true.  But English is too recursive for most recent evidence to work.  Also, there is a lack of research and a lack of resources for secondary classes, especially English."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1389,NA,One of the main ideas of SBG is that the students should be able to practice a skill at least twice (three times?) before they are assessed.  In order to do this in English it would take a really long time between assessments. We also have way too many standards to do this.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1390,NA,I think it works for math.  I am dubious that it works for English or Social Studies.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1391,NA,"When we were able to do an SBG hybrid system, I was able to set up my grade book in a way that differentiated what assignments were practice and which were assessments.  I could also categorize them."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1392,NA,The students and parents do not understand how a student's grade is calculated.  I feel as if I can't explain how the grade is calculated.  There are too many steps.  I am still frustrated when it comes to entering grades.  It takes weeks for District to even enter the standards into the system.  Searching for the right standard to attach to my assignment is tedious because there are so many.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1393,NA,The focus on the standards.  The 0=50%. Skills over compliance.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1394,NA,"If we are going to do it, it should be consistent across the board.  If you find that it is not working for a majority of classes, perhaps that is telling."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1395,NA,I think it's the worst idea ever. It is more work for the teacherss an less accountability for the students. It does not prepare them for college or career.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1396,NA,The students feel like they can just take the SLOs over and over and that they will memorize the answers instead of learning.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1400,NA,"It depends on the content. STEM, no"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1401,NA,"SBG needs to be modified. if we want more teachers on board, we need to look at ""the human"" aspect:
-Have weight to assignments/assessments. In English, I feel like an essay we've been working on should have more weight than an assessment that took one day. I also think Essential Standards should weigh more than supplementary standards. 
-The SBG Conversion Chart should be changed. As of now, the matching percentage to the proficiency level does not align and is inflated. I have talked to other teachers and this is a main reason they don't use SBG.
-We need to properly train rubric creation. As an English teacher, I definitely think writing teachers have a head start on this as writing rubrics are a core part of our grading systems. However, how we we rubric math tests is extremely unclear.
-Teach how to properly make multiple choice tests SBG. It's possible with DOK knowledges."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1402,NA,"The grades are inflated, and I don't think the student's current grade reflects their skill level. This is due to the inflated conversation scale."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1403,NA,Have clearer organization for students and parents. Tracking standards and reassessments is very difficult on studentvue.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1404,NA,Not realistic. We need to balance the philosophy with real world application.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1405,NA,Making sure we circle back to skills for reassessment. I can see how this is difficult for math.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1406,NA,It helps to clarify what I really want my students to know and understand and makes sure that my rubrics and expectations align with the standards as written.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1407,NA,Just the setup of it and lack of it being user friendly makes it harder for people to get on board with SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1408,NA,Reasonable deadlines and averaging
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1409,NA,It focuses in on the standard which is a higher rigor. (Comment for the next question : I think if we enact a district wide policy that says the SLO can't be taken until all practice is completed would encourage that accountability. It has in my class.)
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1410,NA,it works
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1411,NA,"More clearly defined expectations of standards. Also 0 is an acceptable grade if they have not done the work. This shows they have room to improve, and where they need too."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1412,NA,"I teach read 180 to ELL students. Standards are hard to pick, most tasks cover several."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1413,NA,Tasks that cover more than one standard are hard to input for students to see what they need to work on.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1414,NA,"Tasks that cover more than one standard. Not being ""allowed"" to put in a 0"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1415,NA,Students can see what they specifically need to work on.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1437,NA,See answer above
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1438,NA,Allow us to give credit when students do the practice
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1439,NA,Students do not prepare and then they keep reassessing until they get a passing score. The biggest problem I see is that students do not do the practice because they don’t get credit and then they come to the test unprepared and they fail it
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1440,NA,None
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1441,NA,Mos  students do not care to do the work that is not for a grade. CFA's maybe.  They do not study and prepare because they are allowed to retake the SLO's
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1442,NA,"Change to a simple gradebook(user-friendly). This is the most complicated gradebook  I have ever had to use in all of my years of teaching. Also, many students/parents do not use it because they do not understand it. It is too complicated!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1443,NA,"Many of students cannot handle this kind of grading system. They are not disciplined enough and or are not academically strong to succeed in SBG mode. If an activity is not for grading, they are not interested. End result is they fail the SLO, but they do not really care because they can retake the slos.  This is not a good practice. I do not know of any colleges/universities where students are allowed to retake tests. This creates a lot of extra work for the teachers."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1444,NA,"(1) My biggest contention with true SBG is the role of the 0. I think we need to continue to make 0 (or 0 mi) affect the grade (by averaging in as a 50%). (2) In addition, I think PLCs should be allowed to assess standards that are not deemed ""essential"" so long as they are consistent within the site PLC. Let's have ""essential standards"" that are required for at all campuses but put ALL standards into Synergy so that PLCs can choose additional ones to assess based on the needs of their students. (3) I would love some version of the power law back. I understand the point of ""most recent evidence,"" but I think it needs to be balanced against the reality of dealing with teenagers. Old work needs to hold some weight in order for students to be motivated to do it. (4) Let's get rid of the ""incomplete"" as a grade for the class. Students do not need additional weeks after the semester ends to make up their work if teachers are offering huge make-up timelines with no late point deductions. This just puts more work on the teacher and gives way too much leeway to the student. If the 0 is affecting the grade, we don't really need this additional time to get credit."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1445,NA,"SBG is working well in my class by creating an easy to understand, universal way to communicate proficiency. I also feel that as a philosophy it works to help students feel like I see the best in them and I am rooting for them because there is no punishment for past failures or poor behavior. I can tell my students that they have complete power over their grades so long as they seek out help and keep trying."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1446,NA,"I understand the difficulty of using SBG with a content course, however, I think those difficulties could be mitigated (with rewriting learning targets, domains, etc.) and that the benefits of SBG make those challenges worth it."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1447,NA,"I would like the parent/student side of the gradebook to only have ONE ""face""; parents and students don't understand the standards versus assignment view. I would love if they could see ALL assignments nestled under the standard and perhaps the graded versus ungraded ones could be color coded differently."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1448,NA,"Making the 0 NOT impact the overall grade. It is unreasonable to expect that our students and parents (and teachers for that matter) can't use the grade to determine how the student is doing overall, and that we could show them as having an A or a B but then at the end of the year tell them they can't get credit because they have too many missing assignments. What's more, the 30% threshold is unfair because 30% of the work looks different in every class. Please make the 0 continue to bring the grade down but mandate that teachers give ample opportunity for make-ups and no late-deductions (so that behavior is ultimately not punished). This, to me, is still in line with the philosophy but doesn't put a burden on parents and students to completely relearn the meaning of a grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1449,NA,"I really did like SBG because I felt like it really did put emphasis on mastery of a skill over the type of work (homework versus quizzes versus tests etc.) and provided consistency in interpreting grades. I also think that the wide timelines for retakes and the lack of late point deductions did not make my class too easy (as I had initially feared) but just gave me a tool to earnestly encourage my students to not give up half way through the semester. I could tell them and their parents that they could still make a change and that there was no excuse, because there was always something they could be redoing! It really put the responsibility on the student to do the work. Lastly, I love that SBG made me conscientious about how I use my gradebook in terms of documenting behavior. Since I can't take points off, I was forced to find other ways to do this and I found that my gradebook started being really informative for parents. Instead of taking  random points off, I gave them their score and then entered different comment code (late, off-task, phone use, make-up attempt, etc.) to describe any classroom issues. Since these comments show up next to grades, more parents actually noticed them. I do understand that these comments can be used in a traditional gradebook, but it took the conscious separation of academics from behavior to push me to be consistent and I think teachers, parents, and students will benefit from this."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1450,NA,The infinite deadline for assignments isn't working - Logistically it is too difficult to maintain and keep on top of late work and students know they can turn stuff in whenever.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1493,NA,"SBG does not provide an incentive for students to do homework (practice work).  We assume that all students are intrinsically motivated to do the practice.  We need to realize that most students are extrinsically motivated and need that 'carrot' (points for their work). This has led to the majority of students deciding to not do the practice work and a sharp decline in grades. 

SBG has made grading much more difficult and time consuming; writing retakes in some subjects, like Social Studies, is much more difficult.  I may be generalizing, but in math, you can substitute several different numbers into a problem or equation.  In Social Studies, it is difficult to rewrite an authentic assessment such as: ""Write a paragraph comparing the causes and effects of the American and French Revolutions"".  How do I provide an additional authentic and equally rigorous assessment asking the same thing?  For every single assessment, creating a grading scale and trying to calculate how it fits into a 0-4 is extremely time consuming. 

SBG limits my ability to provide timely feedback from assessments to my students.  Traditionally, I would review the answers and common misconceptions with my class shortly after an assessment.  With SBG, I can't do that because once I review the assessment, students have the answers.  

SBG does not account for certain assessments being more important than others; instead they are all weighted the same.  For example, an essay that students spent a week writing is worth the same as a 10 question vocabulary quiz.  

The following aspects of SBG have led to a decline in work ethic and motivation: students can never score lower than a 50% (in SBG, a zero equals 50%); students go into an assessment knowing that they will be able to reassess (why study or try on the first one?)

Our district motto is ""All Students College and Career Ready"".  However, SBG has stifled work ethic, study habits, creativity, group work and collaboration,  and many other skills that students will need after high school."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1494,NA,"Attaching standards to assessments does not work

Grading on a scale of 0-4 does note work

Giving points solely for assessments and not homework does not work.  We know that some people work hard but struggle for whatever reason on assessments.  We should return to traditional grading with all work counting, but being weighted differently."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1496,NA,"There should be NO hybrid, as that is what we are doing now!! We need a better gradebook, we need to look at the way that we are giving grades in the first place (maybe P/F first semester and letter grade second semester, with an F first semester being changed to match what the student scores at the end of second semester-this will truly demonstrate a commitment to learning and not just a need to assign grades). We need to invest in training our teachers. We need to invest in creating assessments. We need support from admin, many of whom unfortunately have no real sense of what SBG entails-pracitcally speaking. Benchmarks need to be effective tools, but should not serve as a grading tool especially if they need to be selected response. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SELECTED RESPONSE ASSESSMENTS IN PROFICIENCY. Selected response assessments can be helpful in a variety of ways, but are not a fair measure of proficiency. Skills should be introduced early and spiraled throughout the year, allowing the end of the year (fourth quarter) to truly be time for enrichment and reteaching while we work towards a capstone (CA). If we adopted that model there's no reason we couldn't finish every year with every student having Cs or higher. That fourth quarter time can be used by teachers to truly collaborate and help one another deliver important skills to struggling students. There is so much potential in this district, but not having a clear plan is what is making this a place where success often feels impossible."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1497,NA,"It isn't working when I hear other teachers talk about not updating grades in six weeks because ""SBG is only about assessments."" It isn't working when teachers believe that SBG just means endless retakes.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1501,NA,"I think that the district should take a targeted approach at working with teachers throughout the year (NOT JUST IN SUMMER BTS DAYS) to create a plan for how their class can work with SBG. Then designated SBG experts should go through that plan with them, offer advice and suggestions where it is needed. Once a course's SBG plan is approved then they can do SBG. Without looking at this on a course by course level it will never be successful. Forcing entire campuses to adopt it, and then leaving some courses to ""figure it out"" on their own, with no resources and no support is and has been a disaster.

Otherwise, students will earn credit for passing without little to no effort on classwork. Teachers are frustrated with the fact that students are putting little effort into practice and still passing the class.  Raising the bar will increase student expectations in completing practice work and earning exceptional grades in their courses.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1532,NA,"Again-from the point of view of a math class, it is not as easily as implemented in the ways that other courses do it, as we build upon unit after unit, and do not always necessarily retest on all topics. Only a few are used throughout the entire school year."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1533,NA,try to incorporate practice into the grade
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1534,NA,"With the mindset of the students needing 100% to keep an A in the class, they are not satisfied with proficiency.  The students that are not doing any work, as soon as an assessment is taken and they receive a 1, the failing grade now becomes a D which is passing, from one assessment"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1535,NA,"For the average student, the grade is the same whether doing SBG or Traditional Grading, it the end of the spectrum where its questionable.  It is difficult to make the students accountable for their actions of completing practice or not when they know retakes are an option."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1536,NA,"One set of standards to use and not a different set for each school.  As a district, we should all be on the same page."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1537,NA,"Each school, plc, and teacher can choose how to do SBG and it is not consistent."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1538,NA,Results of whether the student understood the material or not based on the assessment and the students are not chasing points.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1539,NA,"There has to be some sort of accountability for students. With the current state of SBG, students can barely complete work and pass with hardly any effort. In theory, SBG sounds amazing, but administration has not personally experienced the landslide of overwhelming work teachers must do to keep up with grading, chasing down students, and creating 3 or more versions of each test.  Teaching three classes under the SBG model is crushing my soul and I’m seriously considering moving to another district that doesn’t require SBG. If it wasn’t for the new superintendent giving us additional time on Wednesday, I probably would have quit already."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1540,NA,"Students don’t study for tests because they know they can retake them. Homework and projects constantly arrive late because they know they get an automatic 50% for doing absolutely nothing. I’m constantly meeting with students to encourage them to come in during RTI, before and after school to complete missing work. Grading never seems to end with late work since there is no point deduction for it not arriving on time. The work load with three different classes is absolutely killing me and I don’t have any time to prepare new lessons or extensions for my gifted students. I wont do this next year - hopefully it’s not a district mandate."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1541,NA,I like the component where students are allowed to retake tests.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1542,NA,The grade book became overly complicated this year. It’s 100% not user friendly.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1549,NA,We need to be consistent across the board. The philospohy of the objectives are the essential learning measurements of the student grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1550,NA,biggest issue for me is trying to explain each different gradebook to parents and understanding what a students actual grade is.  It is misleading in some cases.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1551,NA,n/a
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1552,NA,Making it slightly easier for students to get A's and slightly easier for students to fail. The current system makes it nearly impossible for a student to get an A unless they are absolutely perfect in most standards. The system also makes it so easy that a student that can get a few 3's at the beginning of the year on review standards and then just coast for the rest of the semester to still pull a D.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1553,NA,"Students don't do practice work because it's not for a grade. I make the practice work mandatory for retakes, so the students just don't do the retakes."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1554,NA,"It works well for chemistry, but we barely ever get the chance to reassess on the same standard. I feel like it's very disheartening in classes like English to a student when their grade can drop multiple letter grades if the teacher uses most recent."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1555,NA,It is just not very user friendly and buggy. I feel like it's much more tedious to put in grades now more than ever before.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1556,NA,"Too difficult to fail. Students are barely learning anything and being passed on from classes with D's.
Too difficult to get an A. Students must get perfect scores on a good portion of standards in order to get an A. There are teachers who just do not give out 4's, which makes it near impossible to get A's. This leads to students not getting scholarships and just getting burnt out with school.
Reassessing with only most recent scores. I'd like to think every teacher is phenomenal but I know we all aren't perfect. The quality of a reassessment might not be as good as the first time it was given. The teacher might not have reviewed a standard in a month and just threw it into an assessment because it's somewhat related."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1557,NA,"Retakes. A student shouldn't be penalized by how long it takes for them to learn the material.
Slightly more indicative of what college will be like. Most grades in college classes come solely from quizzes/tests. You can't just copy down the answers to a worksheet your friend sent you on Snapchat to pass the class."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1558,NA,"The percentage conversions are way too generous, especially considering students only need a 60% to earn their credit for each course. This equates to a 1, or just minimally proficient. This seems like an extremely low bar to set. I also think we should bring back the power rule to avoid grades being too inflated."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1559,NA,"The grades are much too inflated. If a student scores 0 on 9 standards but a 3 on 1 standard, they're almost ""passing"" the course with a 60%, which is ridiculous."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1560,NA,"Some standards should be worth more than others. I think this was attempted in the creation of domains for each, but that doesn't look to be working correctly? Unless we just can't tell from our end until the semester is completely over. Also, it's really frustrating that the standards to choose from are messy, take forever to be uploaded, and are listed in different places for different scores. Also, we should be able to incorporate professionalism standards - these skills are just as important to student success."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1561,NA,The percentage conversion for SBG grades. (Ex: there should be equal spacing between all SBG grades and a 1 should not be a passing 60%).
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1562,NA,"It's too easy for students to pass, doesn't hold them accountable, and rewards those who figure out how to work the system. I also think we should be able to give some type of midterm and final exam. Only giving short, smaller quizzes requires very little retention. It's like we're assessing short term memory rather than deeper understanding."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1563,NA,It makes it clearer when communicating with students and their parents about which skills they need help with.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1564,NA,I'm not sure it's very conducive for elective courses.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1565,NA,The passing grade needs to be moved up to 70% if we keep it. Students are completely unmotivated and are achieving LESS in my class.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1566,NA,"Students can barely do any work ( do 1 assignment out of 20) and it brings them to passing. If all you want to do is pass, then why would you do the work? So we are shooting ourselves in the foot with achievement.  This current system only helps out graduation rate but you will see a dip in scores.  The ACT is not a standards based test. Please get rid of this elementary grading system!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1567,NA,The gradebook takes too long to calculate scores. It takes 3x as long to input grades.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1568,NA,Teachers are baffled at how to grade when to me our energy should be spent teaching and coming up with good instructional pieces. My mind is blown at why we spend so  much time on how we enter grades in a gradebook.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1569,NA,More kids passing but knowing LESS material.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1570,NA,We are losing good teachers over this.  My answer is WHY?
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1571,NA,"Keep SLOs as the majority of the grade, continue reteach, repractice, and retest. Allow teachers or departments the flexibility to make other things count for a grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1572,NA,The positive: Students are able to revisit old topics in Algebra once they finally click. Their grade is a measurement of how much they understand at the end of the course summatively rather than just formatively.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1573,NA,"The negative: Student accountability is sorely lacking. ""Is this a SLO"" is a common question, and ""if it's not for a grade, then I'm not doing it"" is a common refrain. Other than disciplinary escalation (warning, call home, admin referral), teachers are powerless to get students to do it right the first time."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1574,NA,"0 to 4 grades works well, as does standards alignment with assignments. However, incompletes are inconsistently enforced across teachers and the 50 to 100 grade scale is slightly too lenient (a 3, 3, 3, 3, and 4 results in a 90% A)."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1575,NA,"If I have 200 students and 10 SLOs per student each semester, that is 2000 potential reteach/repractice/retest to organize and administer. Jags Success/power hour/etc could alleviate this if implemented differently (student accountability and possibly punishment)."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1576,NA,"Measuring what student know, and not how they behave. Student agency to retest on not just give up on their grade or their ability as a student."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1577,NA,"Yes, but only for core subjects."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1578,NA,"There is absolutely no accountability, and although it is supposed to only grade/measure student skill, it really has turned into ""is this going in the gradebook?"" and the amount of learning is actually less."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1579,NA,"There is so much more that goes into a classroom that a grade, and SBG only focuses on that. The amount of learning is dininished."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1580,NA,"There are just so many little things that do not work, and some assignments focus on multiple standards, so grading is beyond time consuming and unmanageable."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1581,NA,"Turns kids into students that only care about grades, and learning takes a backseat. Additionally, the amount of skills that are never actually graded or measured is crazy. In addition, students this age should be held accountable for when they turn assignments in."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1582,NA,Can't see any
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1583,NA,"Standards Based Grading practice is essential for our student's success. Everyone, including teachers and admin, need clear expectations and a means to improve upon work that leads to mastery. Students are so much more likely to want to retake a test knowing that if they improve the new score will replace the lower score. Understanding that the score could go down is part of the modification I will suggest. 
Creating a grade book system that allows for teachers to select the same standard for a new assignment is important. For example, if I give a test for RL.1 for Brave New World, then again for Hamlet, the second test should not affect the first test. Now, if a student wishes to retake the Brave New World test, then the score should be modified to reflect the student's growth for that text's understanding. 
Also, I believe it would greatly benefit our district if we revisited the task of creating District Rubrics and make them available for each department as a whole. Ideally, the rubric I use for RL.1 for Brave New World at Canyon View can be the same Rubric an English 4 teacher at Verrado uses for the same text. It would be incredible to not only talk about data as a site PLC, but then as a district PLC as well. 
As our English department moves toward using Study Sync for 9 - 12 it may greatly benefit new and veterans teacher alike to have access to the same rubrics for both quality instruction and Data Digs. 
Thank you."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1584,NA,"As mentioned above, when retesting the same standard for a different text SBG works against the previous progress students have made by changing the score from the previous text(s). It would help to be able to label the standard RL.4 A, RL.4 B and so on, to differentiate various texts."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1585,NA,Same reason as already stated.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1586,NA,The grade book work fine. What needs modification is the option to use the same standard for various texts without the new score for the new text affecting the score for the old text.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1587,NA,"1) Consistency throughout the district 
2) Stakeholder *Commitment
3) Common Rubrics 
4) Availability to use the same Standard more than once within"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1588,NA,"Standards Based Grading greatly and undeniably benefits our students in various ways. It eliminates the option for teachers to insert non-standards-based assignments and holds our teachers accountable to help our students master the standards at hand. 
     It gives our students and parents/guardians clear-cut expectations for success in any given subject area. When rubrics are correctly utilized, SBG provides even more concise expectation for mastery of standards. 
     Lastly, SBG provides the option for students to continue toward mastery of a standard knowing that what we as the educators want more than anything is to help him or her succeed in understanding and applying the material to his or her learning, as well as life. In many ways, SBG helps teachers focus on mastery of standards as much as it helps students to do the same."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1589,NA,Do not make it mandatory and allow people to choose the best system of grading for them
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1590,NA,"It has created an environment of apathy around the classroom, students unsure if they need to do the work, no incentive to do work on time."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1591,NA,I think it can work but no one should be forced into do it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1592,NA,It seems like synergy and SBG are not at all compatible.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1593,NA,"Lack of accountabilty, no teacher discretion for grading practices, students and parents left unsure how they are being assessed."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1594,NA,It can help the kids with high work rates and a great work ethic.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1595,NA,"I think it would be a mistake to mandate a certain grading practice and force all teachers into doing it. If teachers are comfortable with doing SBG, they should feel empowered to use it, if they are not comfortable with it, they should feel empowered and supported as well."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1596,NA,"what I have noticed in the general classes that I assisted in it does not benefit the student that work hard to do their work and have another student that doesn't do their work and can get the same score as another student. An unnecessary and  unfair  of grading way because it places all emphasis on assessments and performance tasks and most coursework does not count toward the final class grade. This means that students must do well on all tests, which adds unnecessary stress."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1597,NA,Where google classroom and the grade book could be linked for everything to add in smoothly.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1598,NA,Doesnt hold the students accountable for doing practice work and that if they do well on their test they do not need to do any other assignments in class and can pass vs other students that do all of their work an test and can have the same grade as another that slacks in class.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1599,NA,nothing that I have noticed as of yet.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1600,NA,some classes do not benefit from using SBG and some might be able to use it based on the class used in but should not be used in core classes
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1601,NA,"1) Apply traditional models of scoring, like a 10-point scale, to allow for more complete and authentic differentiation when grading. Students, especially in today's world of alternate sources for information, and difficult wording and phraseology describing new ideas or ways of seeing information, vitally need to understand nuance and context, which is impossible to grade effectively in a 4-point system.
2) Allow for more than single category grading, like focusing only on Assessments, which is detrimental to students who do not test well, and does not reflect rewarding students for effort or hold them accountable for their long-term choices. Referring to completion of Assignments as ""practice"" is counterintuitive to student success, especially as coaches often require practice be completed in order for athletes to play in games.
3) Allow for students to encounter a variety of assignment types, instead of purely focusing on testing. Constant testing is detrimental to students' mental health, as well as oppositional to the concept that education can be fun as well as being rewarding. Even teachers who endorsed the SBG system before have begun to change their opinions on the policy due to the unreasonable expectations on student performance.
4) Allow for teachers to hold more autonomy in the creation and instruction of their courses.  Staff morale is at an all-time low, and will continue to decline as long as teachers are denied the respect and understanding that is afforded to any other college-educated professional job."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1602,NA,"The use of the Unfair Zero (i.e. students not scoring a zero on actually submitted work) has been helpful for students in any course. However, students still seem to think that the policy means that they can submit NO work, and still receive a viable score on the assessment or assignment. This misguided thinking leads to students refusing to do work at all, and has resulted in more and more students with low grades, which is the exact opposite reason provided for its use by SBG."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1603,NA,"Content courses that are humanities courses are qualitative courses, not quantitative courses. For courses like math or science, the use of SBG may make sense, especially if the standards that are used in the course are sequential. Humanities courses, like ELA and Fine Arts courses, are usually not sequential in their standards banks, and require constant focus on multiple standards at once, like when close reading an excerpt of a text, or creating an artistic work through homage, in order for a student to grasp advanced concepts, and formulate them on their own.

The material used for instruction in qualitative courses also reflect those differences of interpretation, which is not something conducive to learning in science courses or finite mathematics courses: in a humanities course, the interpretation of a work is theoretical, and supported by argument and evidence, whereas elsewhere, the mathematical or scientific answer may be quite set, and needs only one method to reach (even if the same focus of ""showing your work"" is analogous to supporting evidence in a rhetorical argument)."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1604,NA,"The current gradebook requires too many special codes and screens and options to be effective. The only thing that seems to work for inputting grades is the ""Classic Gradebook View"" option, which does not require the user to be ""in a special mode"" (like Standards View or Assignment View) or a select screen in order to record grades. In addition, the need for SBG to be run through a special algorithm in order to score correctly on a 100% scale is concerning and confusing, and would be unnecessary if traditional grading was used again."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1605,NA,"The system of SBG was designed for mathematics instruction, and not for any other type of course or class. It also does not reflect actual effort invested in learning and skill development and acquisition for students who do not perform well on assessments, or individual learning styles, which may impact how a student is able to perform on assessments."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1606,NA,"Allowing students to retake assessments or assignments benefits students who can relearn and reapply their understanding, and not scoring zeros on assignments or assessments, except for nonsubmission of work, strengthens a student's resolve to complete their work as assigned. These seem to be the concepts that are also most referenced and used by students under the SBG formula, while students dislike the constant testing and non-scoring of assignment work or ""practice."""
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1607,NA,"Policies that are uniform across several demographics are often difficult to create, and even more difficult to enforce, especially when those policies do not allow for differences in student demographics, like the obvious differences in student demographics at all five campuses (i.e. learning styles, etc.). If the district is going to enact a district-wide policy on grading, then it needs to benefit ALL student groups, not just those that excel at a specific style of assessment-making."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1608,NA,"Students do not complete practice work, thus affecting performance on exams."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1609,NA,"Retakes, but that's about it."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1612,NA,It really only makes sense for the math courses to utilize it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1613,NA,"I agree with the philosophy behind SBG 100%; however, I think that we need to do a better job of educating teachers, students, and parents about SBG as well as creating a school/district culture to support SBG. As far as teacher training, I've been in the district for several years, and I have tried to make SBG work; however, I feel as though I haven't been given the time nor the information to truly make SBG effective in my classroom. We were given a lot of training about the philosophy and the basic idea of SBG (which I agree with), but next to no time to work with our teams to digest and implement SBG. I also think it's important to note that SBG works differently among different academic disciplines. SBG looks different in an English classroom vs. a math classroom. I would like more specific training regarding how SBG works in an English classroom.  

As far as students, it is undeniable that students are motivated by grades and not always learning. SBG requires that the students are motivated by learning and not necessarily grades. This is a paradigm shift that needs to be addressed school-wide and district-wide. How do we motivate students to meet deadlines and complete assignments that are not always assessed? We need to focus on answering this question in a practical way."

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1619,NA,"I love the general concept of grading by standard, but honestly the gradebook is a nightmare and takes forever to load. It is clearly not ready. Additionally, the lack of a true zero has created a serious accountability problem for students.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1671,NA,"Hard for students and parents to understand. It was difficult for me to understand. I'm getting better at it, but this is my 2nd year using SBG. It shouldn't take a teacher years to understand how to grade students, in my opinion. I also don't think a 0 should equal 50."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1672,NA,"I have always graded my students based on music standards, whether national or statewide, however it was done in a traditional grade book, which is much easier to understand and convey to the students and parents. I don't personally see benefits of SBG for my content area."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1673,NA,"I think SBG, the way it is set up is not usefull for a performance class. Maybe core content subjects."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1674,NA,I'm not a classroom teacher but it does not necessarily fit easily into all programs.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1675,NA,I don't know specifics.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1676,NA,"While the concept of SBG is strong and valuable.  It is such a paradigm shift, it would require clarity from the beginning and I don't believe it fits for all courses/programs."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1677,NA,It’s not reflective of how the actual world works. We are not preparing these students for college OR careers. They won't get do-overs in either scenario and they certainly won't be able to turn in work late. Kids have no motivation to practice or prepare for assessments ahead of time. They won't turn anything in unless they know it will be graded . They are not learning how to study and/or take any responsibility for their own learning. There's also a big difference between a 3 and a 4. We should be able to give half scores.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1678,NA,It probably does work for English or languages or even social studies where you’re looking at how their writing progresses over time.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1679,NA,It's cumbersome to say the least- and way too specific in some courses. I like how it's set up in bio but not environmental.  I should be able to choose the science standard (1-8) and the corresponding unit and have that be it. I do like that it's averaged though rather than most recent evidence.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1680,NA,answered above
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1681,NA,?
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1682,NA,I don't think it's a great fit for some courses.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1683,NA,I will continue to assess skills.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1684,NA,"SBG helps me focus in on how students are performing on each skill. Students understand that learning is not a one shot assessment, but instead a progressive response to their learning. I found that after the initial shock of SBG, and students realizing that they really do need to complete the practice to learn the skills, students are more likely to take risks because they understand that the skill will continue throughout the entire year."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1685,NA,The way the standards are available
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1686,NA,"This student/parent mindset that only assessments are graded. Assessments do not need to be big exams. They should be small and throughout the lesson, practiced and reassessed multiple times. SBG should make assessing invisible in the classroom."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1687,NA,Not really. It's just a different way to grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1688,NA,Teachers who don't understand how to grade with SBG should not be forced into it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1689,NA,Figure out components that hold students responsible to work on a daily basis
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1690,NA,I'm currently experimenting with a hybrid SBG.  I believe it takes away from our professionalism as teachers.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1691,NA,Social studies can move forward without a student understand the previous content.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1692,NA,ease of use
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1693,NA,The focus has shifted from instruction to grading.  It is too focused on the science and not the art of teaching.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1694,NA,SBG is a more natural fit for some content areas but not for others
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1695,NA,"Because my class is basically project based, SBG is great for Theatre.  Most of my Thespian kids, when competing, are adjucated on an SBG scale so it fits with what my ""end goal"" for them would be.  The only thing that gets ""wonky"" is when I have to toggle between two different places to put ""Incompletes"" into the grade book - I've started just putting in a zero so that it drops their grade so that they get they are missing something."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1696,NA,"I would like the ""Incomplete"" function to work from the main gradebook page where I put in the grades.  Having to search for an incomplete key on another screen is confusing."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1697,NA,"I think with everyone NOT using SBG, it becomes confusing for students and families.  I think we need to be all in or nothing!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1698,NA,"For my subject, Theatre, SBG grading aligns with the state & national trends.  SBG again also grades based on what a students knows & can demonstrate, not how they behave or how timely they are in their presentations."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1699,NA,Make were a student that never comes to school can still pass the class because we start at 50%. Stop starting at 50%
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1700,NA,"Have have students passing doing nothing, only 10% of the work"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1701,NA,A lot of work placing in one assignment
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1702,NA,STOP STARTING AT 50%
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1703,NA,Standards are were we get the grade
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1704,NA,It does not work for every content
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1705,NA,School-wide accountability measures for students to complete their work (NOT teacher-led initiatives that will require extra work for already overworked teachers- these initiatives would have to be SCHOOL WIDE and administratively-backed)
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1706,NA,"I used SBG in the past and it did not work for my class, so I went back to a tradtional(ish) grade book. In the past, it did not account for students' overall understanding of the concepts and allowed many students to fail due to lack of incentive to understand concepts and the idea that doing assignments was optional"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1707,NA,N/a to me
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1708,NA,"There is no accountability for students to complete their work, and it is almost impossible to fail"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1709,NA,"SBG allows for retakes, which is a sound policy and should always be allowed"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1710,NA,"There is not a clear-cut and consistent way that teachers have been taught to do SBG for varying subjects, so why would all subjects be expected to figure out how to do that without being clearly versed on how to do so?"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1711,NA,There is a problem with accountability and students understanding the gradebook. It is even more difficult when there isn't consistency between counselors administration and other teachers also teaching SBG. Because of this students and parents don't understand their grades and it is difficult to justify grades. There is also a lot of bugs in the updated SBG gradebook that makes its calculations inaccurate
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1712,NA,"There are some benefits to SBG but, without consistent policies being employed and effective tools, these benefits are lost"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1713,NA,I would like the gradebook to not include the assignment view at all if it is sbg there should also be better training on how to explain the gradebook to students and parents
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1714,NA,If we force teachers to use SBG there will not be consistent adoption of policies just people searching for loopholes that allow them to use SBG without actually using the grading method.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1715,NA,Minimal impact of missing work
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1716,NA,Could be good but students aren’t held accountable for late or missing work
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1717,NA,"Standards listed in the gradebook are overwhelming and when you choose the wrong standard and try to change it, it erases the assignment grades. It is just not easily fixed or managed."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1718,NA,Participation and grade inflation
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1719,NA,It works for some and not others.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1720,NA,"The students, the parents and the teachers are confused. This is not reality or assisting in having our students ""college and career ready"". Students really do nothing now and can do 1 'No Red Ink' and get a 60%. This is not ok, and I have students literally just sitting here. I'm extremely disheartened."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1721,NA,Going back to classic
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1722,NA,"The confusion, more work for teachers."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1723,NA,NONE
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1724,NA,It is exceptionally difficult to teach English with one standard at a time because the skills are interconnected. Ex. teaching how a theme develops also requires teaching skills like figurative language
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1725,NA,A way to better determine how a student is doing on each standard
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1726,NA,"Students can complete only a small handful of the classwork and finish with a D. I understand the utility of SBG conceptually, and I do think it benefits students, but completing only 1/3 of the assessments/assignments should not automatically mean a student passes"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1727,NA,"The directive and expectations should come from district if it something the district would like to keep using SBG, but I don't think it works effectively as presently constructed for English."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1728,NA,where attendance and current grades are next to each other
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1729,NA,It works sometimes but I feel like it is confusing and hard to evaluate the students accurately all time.  The scale that was given doesn't always show the work of the student.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1730,NA,It isn't very user friendly and I think we need more training on it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1731,NA,"It doesn't accurately show the students grade, the scale is very large from a 1-2-3-4. It also doesn't hold the students accountable for all of the learning taking place in class.  The "" not for grading"" seems pointless.  They don't do it because it's not graded.  It also gives students too many chances to re-do or make up grades.  There is almost no reason to have a due date because they can turn it in whenever."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1732,NA,I am not sure
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1733,NA,If wee are going to use SBG as a district it needs to be ONE set plane for ALL Campuses and ALL Departments.  What makes it so hard is that every school and teacher does it different.  It also makes it difficult as a parent in the district to know how your child is being graded.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1734,NA,"The scale should not go from 50 - 100%. It needs to go from 40-100% so that the grades break down equally, so that minimally proficient is 55% and is not passing, partially proficient should be 70%, proficient should be 85%."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1735,NA,I don't think minimally proficient should be a passing grade. I think a 50% for not doing the assignment is way to generous and does not hold the students accountable.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1736,NA,It works better for math where standards are more separated. It does not make sense for English where one essay could include multiple standards.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1737,NA,"To use the SBG functions, it is ridiculous to have to have all of the standards pre-loaded by someone else!"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1738,NA,There is almost no penalty for a student missing an assignment or assessment. A 50% is too generous.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1739,NA,"Easy to grade, student's grades are based on assessments, not completion of assignments."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1740,NA,Teacher need autonomy to run their classrooms as they see fit. SBG does not work for every content. Each CAT should decide.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1741,NA,The gradebook is fine. SBG is a transformational change that needs to be explicitly explained to all campuses. It is also a philosophical change that goes against many teachers' current teaching style. You cannot just slap SBG on top of the current teaching and learning that happens in the classroom. Classroom practices have to adjust to SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1742,NA,"The modifications that need to be done are mostly with the Infosystems, not the actual idea of SBG...  As in, how are standards/targets being populated and nested in Synergy? I prefer Learning Targets over broad standard...  This makes last score work really well (a component that many people have gripes about). The 4.0 scale needs to be rolled back to what it was a few years ago-- an 88% is WAY TOO HIGH for a 3."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1743,NA,Very important that Synergy has the standards/targets loaded properly at the beginning of the year. Synergy needs to be better about reporting incomplete (IW vs. IS) and fixing how the 4.0 scale communicates percentages and letters.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1744,NA,Forcing outdated curriculum and broad standards to work...  We need to make sure that GVC is ACTUALLY GUARANTEED AND VIABLE across all sites before forcing all-in. Teams must have continued flexibility to grade with Learning Targets. If I was forced to use a state standard I would not be able to use SBG well at all.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1745,NA,SBG is amazing-- the grade is actually WHAT THEY KNOW. It removes so many barriers that cause harm to various student groups. The reassessment and perpetual refinement of knowledge are such amazing growth-mindset premises that help good teachers become great.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1746,NA,"Some content areas may need product-based or portfolio-based grading (fine arts, CTE, PE perhaps). There should be flexibility-- content teams should be consistent with each other, but I don't see the need for vastly different content areas forced into the same grading practices."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1747,NA,"Does NOT give kids a realistic view of their progress/grade NOR does it provide a realistic view of how their actions/non-actions are met in reality - such as having infinite opportunities for changing something (test grade, coming in late to work...) required for life.  Like showing up and actually working."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1748,NA,I don't know what you mean about content courses.  Aren't all courses content?  Is it supposed to be core classes?  I don't think it works for those either...for the same reasons.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1749,NA,"Honestly, I cannot understand enough to answer this intelligently."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1750,NA,It does not hold kids accountable for real-life.  NOBODY GETS INFINITE CHANCES.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1751,NA,"Curriculum needs to be aligned with standards anyway, so I cannot think of any major benefits."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1752,NA,"It does not work with IB curriculum, AP curriculum, and possibly others.  It is assessment driven, Visual Arts is a PROCESS and cannot be measured by test resulte."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1753,NA,I wouldn't give unit/chapter tests that have 3+ standards and give 1 grade. I would give quizzes on 1 or 2 standards and put scores for each in the gradebook. I would also make homework worth 15% to encourage students to do it more often.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1754,NA,"Not grading assignments or making them worth enough points would decentivize students from actually doing it when they first learned it. Even if you make them do it to do retakes ( and not give them points still), it just becomes a hoop to jump through that many would cheat on and hard to manage and grade at the last minute."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1755,NA,Look at previous answer
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1756,NA,I don't use the SBG gradebook.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1757,NA,"I don't like the 0 to 4 scale. Percentages are more real world, so most people understand them.  I compensate the big F range on my percentage scale, by giving 30% as the lowest grade on assessments if they try it. I don't like the giving of a 50% as the lowest grade, because half points for not trying it or poorly understanding it seems underserving."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1758,NA,Offering multiple chances to understand and score better on a standard is a plus. Trying to make it easier for students grades not to get hammered for low grades on the percentage scale (although 50% are too underserving. 30% for trying is my compromise)
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1759,NA,"Math should be practiced every day to retain it. Other subjects may not need that, so don't require it for all."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1760,NA,"Im fine with the structure of SBG but we need to figure out another way to hold the students accountable for deadlines. The philosophy on our campus is to accept late work with no penalty at any time throughout the semester. With no way to hold the students accountable for late work, it is impossible to make progress with individual standards because the students fall so far behind in content."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1761,NA,Constant late work and not enough time to write re-take exams
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1762,NA,n/a
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1763,NA,"has no framework for addressing late work, puts too much work on instructor to grade late work, create multiple retake exams, and regrade exam retakes while still progressing in course materials and required standards."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1764,NA,acknowledges student growth
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1765,NA,"the grade book is not user friendly or student friendly. The inputting of grades in different areas, students having multiple views on studentvue is confusing for them"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1766,NA,"student work accountability, inflated grades based on 50% as a zero but 60% to pass, the grade book set up."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1767,NA,The idea to assess students on what they know/standards. This can easily be done without SBG using traditional grading and accountability.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1768,NA,"If SBG type grading works for a particular teacher that's great, but I see a system we are trying to force to work and constantly tweaking only to create more problems."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1769,NA,"Grade CFAs and some practice assessments as well- e.g. SLO, CFA and 2 practice assessments per Standard."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1770,NA,Students will not take CFAs seriously if it is not graded. Majority (80%) of the students will not do practice assessments if they know that it is not graded.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1771,NA,"Students do not take CFAs seriously since they know that it is not graded. Majority of the students does not do practice since they know that practice assessments are not graded. In return, there are a number of students who does not understand the Algebra 1 concepts really well. If I do not require students to take all the practices first and review the resources posted in their Google Classroom, then they still get a lower score when retaking SLOs."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1772,NA,I would like to grade CFA and some practice assessments.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1773,NA,Some students are too complacent. They know that they can retake the SLOs so they do not pay attention to the lectures/class instructions.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1774,NA,The students that are struggling with the concepts but striving  hard to learn can really benefit from SBG. It help them understand the concepts well.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1775,NA,Kids don't care about doing work in class. They try to turn in everything as late as possible le and it's always copied from another student.  They don't actually learn in SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1776,NA,Kids don't care about doing work in class. They try to turn in everything as late as possible le and it's always copied from another student.  They don't actually learn in SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1777,NA,It's complicated
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1778,NA,Kids don't care about doing work in class. They try to turn in everything as late as possible le and it's always copied from another student.  They don't actually learn in SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1779,NA,It works for Math. That's it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1780,NA,"It only works in Math, atleast thats what some math teachers say. It doea t work for most classes, atleast thats what moat teachwrs say who are not trying to suck it to admin."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1781,NA,Our rubrics and CFAs help keep our PLC on the same page.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1782,NA,Consolidated and less views
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1783,NA,I don't think there are any major problems.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1784,NA,"Teach the standard, grade the standard, reteach the standard if needed"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1785,NA,"Students understand what is and isn't for a grade, so they pick and choose what they want to do. Also, the scores are inflated."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1786,NA,"Students have large learning gaps in thier Math fundamentals and content learned in 7th and 8th grade. So, previous learning targerts that need to be covered for students to be able to do well on actual content students are checking out because it is not for a grade. Also, students can do absolutely nothing in class and on assessments, but they just need to a few assessments and score a 1 or 2 to boost up thier grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1787,NA,I don't know the gradebook enough to comment.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1788,NA,Grades are inflated and coursework that leads up to the assessment do not count.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1789,NA,"If scores were not inflated, then it would provide a true understanding of content proficiency."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1790,NA,The new version is not very easy to use.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1791,NA,"Students have very little accountability with SBG as it now stands. They don't see the value in the ""practice"" assignments, and so there is very little motivation to do them, especially for the kids that already struggle with motivation. I have exponentially more missing assignments from this semester than I ever have before, and I think it's because of the attitude that ""it doesn't affect my grade so it doesn't matter."""
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1792,NA,"My science course doesn't really use the same skills repeatedly, once we cover a topic then we move on to the next. Students show mastery of that standard, then move on, and rarely revisit it. In my understanding of SBG philosophies, the purpose is to keep revisiting things. I can see how it could work for a skills based class like English, but not for science. I have observed other content-based teachers who do use SBG and they've made it work, but I would have to significantly restructure the flow of my class to do that."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1793,NA,"The gradebook is a dumpster fire. It was not ready for rollout at the start of the year, and it's not terribly supportive of an SBG environment. There are so many bugs and issues I've encountered this year, from standards not being inputted, to calculating scores wrong, and being inconsistent on when it works and when it doesn't. Additionally, students are very unclear on how to navigate StudentVue, despite multiple attempts on my part to show them how. Having ""assignment view"" as the default, when the assignments aren't what counts, is very confusing, and once they get to ""standards view"" it isn't much better. There is a critical breakdown in what I put in there and what gets communicated to students and parents, because the communications tool is so obtuse. Also, I hate that I can't have a holistic view of how students are doing - I have to either look at the standards, or look at the assignments, but it's really difficult to see both simultaneously. Things that do work - I like that I cant group things by unit. That's a nice upgrade from the previous gradebook. But really, that's about it. It's been a miserable tool to navigate and use, and near useless when it comes to communicating status with students and parents."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1794,NA,"- There is very low student accountability. There is a perception among students that ""I can turn anything in anytime, so I can put it off indefinitely."" They also don't see the value in ""practice work,"" there is definitely an attitude of ""if it doesn't affect my grade than it's not worth doing."" 
- Communication to the community has been really poor. Parents and students don't really understand what SBG is or why we're doing it, and the gradebook is so obtuse it's been really difficult to talk to parents about their student's status. I would love to see more focused communication from the school and district. Big grading shifts that I'm not 100% in control of make it hard to explain to parents, over and over and over again. 
- It's nearly impossible to fail. Students have to actually work to fail. I'm all for high student achievement, but looking at my grades compared to previous years, there definitely seems to be some inflation going on. On the flipside, it's really hard to do well. I'm having many more Bs and Cs than I typically would for this time of year, but not nearly enough As - because that requires a high level of perfection that isn't required in regular grading. 
- It takes SO MUCH TIME. Pre-SBG, I would grade some things on completion and some on mastery. Grading 150 assignments on mastery x number of assignments per week is a high workload. 
- The math is weird. It feel completely arbitrary what students actually receive from the scores I input. It feels like I put numbers in a system and some random number pops out, and I can't entirely explain to students why they have the grade they do. That's problematic. 
- We're not helping our students be college and career ready if there is such little option to fail. College will most certainly not be SBG. Career achievement is not like SBG. By inflating grades artificially through SBG, we're not preparing them for the way achievement is measured later in their academic life. 
- The tools we are using in Synergy are trash. Find a better tool. (See description of problems above.)"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1795,NA,"I like the philosophies of students getting multiple chances. I also like the philosophy of being able to see what students know, rather than grading based on behavior (like docking for late). I can incorporate those positive philosophies in a traditional gradebook though."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1796,NA,Teachers need autonomy over their courses. I should get to decide with my PLC how I want to grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1797,NA,Get rid of the huge retesting window.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1798,NA,"Kids know they can only do the last assignment to show most recent evidence. Now we can stop them from doing that if we say, hey it was late or you have missing assignments leading up to that final test. The issue is, the missing assignments and late work is easy to stay on top of if the population of kids slacking is small. Unfortunately, the numbers of students who do not work or do not turn things in, in my class, is very large...which makes my assignment tracking, feedback, and retests a huge process and more work on me."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1799,NA,After the gradebook was configured it is difficult to sometimes assess the standard based on the skill listed in the gradebook - although teachers were the ones who put these content/skills in the right spots...it is NOT a perfect system and so it is actually just more difficult to align.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1800,NA,"If an assignment has multiple standards built in, entering the the multiple standard grades for one assignment is HELL."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1801,NA,Not everyone knows how to do it. Now everyone wants to do it. It is confusing for kids. Parents don't get it. the 0 = 50% is a joke. It is literally just making grading confusing. If we wanted to stop giving extra credit for tissue or stop lowering a kids English grade because he isn't an artist...just say that.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1802,NA,IT MAKES PASSING FOR THE KIDS SOOOOOOOO EASY. It is also not real life so it is setting them up to fall hard on their face.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1803,NA,"What we need is for someone to say THIS is how we are doing it. One way, all departments, across the board. But it is too messy the way it is right now to implement something like that."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1804,NA,"It fails to teach students all the soft skills that really matter and will transition to adulthood ie studying for exams, being prepared the first time, meeting deadlines, planning ahead, responsibility, and time management."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1805,NA,Students are not taking class work seriously because they know they get a retake. Studying for exams and homework are nonexistent.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1806,NA,Base it off actually test scores that students earned. Not giving a student 50% when they only knew 20% of the material then claiming the 50% is “an accurate reflection of what they know”.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1807,NA,"Everything I previously stated. It completely saps student motivation, especially when it comes to doing practice work that they know will not be graded. Most students are not simply motivated by telling them doing the practice will help them do better on the test, especially when they are given multiple retakes."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1808,NA,It improves graduation rates giving the impression to parents that students are learning.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1809,NA,Make the scale more user-friendly.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1810,NA,Its got to be streamlined; one click for setup and input of grades.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1811,NA,Consistency; ALL teachers have their own understanding of it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1812,NA,Focuses on what students know rather than students just completing tasks.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1813,NA,SBG doesn't fit well with CTE standards/project basis. It also doesn't leave much room for motivation on practice work.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1814,NA,Too much for the time I have on this survey - sorry.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1815,NA,It also doesn't leave much room for motivation on practice work. We haven't had the change to adapt project work to non-point structure.  It's hard to weight uneven standards. Open ended time frames for reassessment create too much extra work for teachers.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1816,NA,I think its a hard fit for CTE.  It's one of the reasons I'm opting out of teaching.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1817,NA,"SBG itself does not need to be modified - but perhaps our district’s implementation does. SLOs/Learning Targets need to be fixed: one, carefully written district set per course, heavily skill based without tiny content specifics so students can actually show growth. More training for teachers on the shift of instruction and assessment practices that support SBG, and more work communicating its purpose and benefits to students/parents. A consistent SBG district handbook to help clarify things for all would be helpful, and support for it district-wide is needed. It takes time and work to untrain students to chase points and percentages, but it is important work we should do. Arguments can be made about the fairest way to report proficiency in the gradebook and calculate grades (I prefer most recent evidence or mode) but  “going back to traditional grading” means going backwards to a system that wasn’t really working for student learning (even if teachers felt it was “working” for them). Today’s students don’t need us to go back to “traditional” anything."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1818,NA,"From all of my conversations with teachers, it seems that in the classes where teachers have embraced the philosophy, where they talk about learning targets and student proficiency, and instruction and assessment practices and policies are aligned with the principles of SBG - it is working fairly well (gradebook frustrations aside). Students can identify what they're supposed to learn, and have indicated they like a system that doesn't punish them for learning at a different pace. Students in those courses know they must complete practice to assess or reassess and teachers are using rubrics to give more meaningful feedback than a score of say 87%. Those teachers and students are having conversations about learning and not just points, and those teachers are motivating and holding students accountable without points. They are proactive in their communication with students and parents as well. However, in the classrooms of teachers that are either opposed or indifferent to SBG, it often isn’t working very well. Instruction and assessment practices must shift for SBG to work and that hasn't happened in all classes yet."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1819,NA,"We don’t get to explain what IS working? I don’t think this is about content as much as it is implementation. The reality is that much of the “content” we teach in high school will be forgotten or never used by students in the future, so the focus should be more on building skills in most classes. This is a tough educational philosophy shift for many teachers and I understand why they want to hang on to their content requirements. But the underlying principles of SBG remain the same regardless of what content is being taught. The only place I could see some issues are in classes where participation and attempts are part of the goal (and maybe that just comes back to writing the SLOs in a more meaningful and useful way for those courses?)  I also understand in CTE they have professional standards they use to assess students (I hope that their curriculum includes helping teach students those standards not just grading them) and I assume many teachers would like to have those “professional standards” in their content classes so they can “hold kids accountable” for behavior too. However, unless we are TEACHING those professionalism standards in all courses, it doesn’t seem fair to assess them and include them in the grade in all courses. Content teachers that are focusing on actual skills seem to be having an easier time and finding more success with SBG."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1820,NA,"The new gradebook this year has wonderful options and the teachers that have embraced it seem to be finding more success. Being able to go back and forth between assignment view (to put grades in for several standards on one assignment) to standards view (to view growth over time) are both great options for teachers. There are still too many options though - maybe that is because it still has to work for traditional graders?  Also, many of the learning targets/SLOs as written are problematic and some teachers are designing activities and THEN deciding which standard they fall closest to in the gradebook. As I said earlier, one set of well-written SLOs per course - not five different ones. And ParentVue/StudentVue on the other hand are VERY difficult for parents/students to understand. There are so many options, so many things to click, so much unnecessary info that gets in the way of clearly reporting progress. If the whole purpose of the online gradebook is to clearly communicate that to parents/students, Synergy struggles to do that in its current form."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1821,NA,"There aren’t problems with SBG - only perhaps issues with its implementation and practice that we can improve. If educators believe all students can learn, but learn at different rates - that’s SBG. If educators believe students should be allowed to make mistakes and grow in their learning - that’s SBG. If educators believe that students should master skills and content and not just chase points - that’s SBG. However, if educators believe that “holding students accountable” still means taking away late points or limiting opportunities to learn and reassess - then I can see why some might see SBG as a “major problem”. Maybe the issue is that teachers are being asked not only to change how they “grade”, but also how they instruct and assess and not all were fully ready (or willing) to change. Change is hard and teachers may need much more support to help shift their practice forward."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1822,NA,"While I do have my own anecdotal experience where I have seen my children be more successful in some SBG classes, and having conversations with them and their friends about their learning, to answer this question I will also rely on the thousands of schools and teachers across the country successfully using some form of SBG to focus on learning not points to answer this question. I’ll defer to experts who’ve done research and used it in practice like Thomas Guskey, Rick Wormeli, Myron Dueck, Robert Marzano, Doug Reeves, and others. I’ll point to the #ungrading movement and all of the professional resources available to help schools and teachers make the shift to a philosophy and system that values learning over task completion.  I also believe the benefits are wrapped up in what we are trying to do with PLCs too. I have spent the past 5 years reflecting on my own old grading practices and learning about better ways to do it. I have spent time researching what works in SBG classrooms and gathering ideas and strategies to help teachers make the shift. It would be impossible for me to move backwards now. And for those worried about “not preparing students for the real world” I recommend they watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM-3PFfIfvI"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1823,NA,"We don’t get to explain why we think all departments SHOULD be required to use it? Either we, as a district, believe that grading for mastery is what is in the BEST INTEREST OF OUR STUDENTS or it doesn’t matter. If we let teachers, or PLCs, or schools continue to pick and choose, then we are saying that SBG must not be a better philosophy for student assessment, and that our district assessment practices really don’t have much of an impact on student learning after all. I can see maybe making some slight modifications for certain areas (PE, or AP courses for example) but either the district is committed to making grading better, more equitable, and more clearly defined and supported for everyone - or then it just needs to be left up to individual teachers if they choose to continue SBG or go back to traditional grading. It would be unfair to force any teachers to go back to an assessment system they know is not in the best interest of their students. Old keys don’t unlock new doors."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1824,NA,kids know about SbG and it doesnt help kids for future

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1827,NA,none
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1828,NA,should be up to teachers
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1829,NA,When used correctly it works well to let students and their families know exactly what they are doing well and what areas they need to improve on. It gives them a chance to show true growth over time.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1830,NA,The gradebook is a big part of the hesitancy with SBG. It would help tremendously to change the gradebook to one that communicates SBG better and more clearly shows how the grade is calculated.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1831,NA,"Not a problem with the practice, just need to communicate it better and educate staff on it more."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1832,NA,Grades mastery of a skill and not behavior and completion. Knowing and mastering a skill is a lot more important in the future than completion of tasks for points.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1833,NA,The fact that you have to make a rubric for every graded assignment is ridiculous. To me it feels like it takes away the freedom of a classroom as in I cannot come up with an assessmet on the fly based of of student conversation because I have to make a rubric and give it to the kids before I give the assessment. Studnets do not abide by any deadlines even when you give them 2 weeks past the original deadline. They won't do work unless it affects their grade or you put in a 0 and then they will want to do the work and then it piles on more grading for the teacher and backlogging of grades. It is more work than it should be for a teacher. And students are not held accountable for anything regarding their grades with SBG.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1834,NA,Students don't do their work and their grade significantly fluctuate with one bad or good grade. It does not represent their long term knowledge.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1835,NA,When an assessment has multiple standards attached to it you have to add those grade individually. For example if you have an assessment with 3 standards you have to put in 3 grades for EACH student. Our classes sizes are big even though we were told they would be smaller and that is why we let go 3-4 science teachers last year so if you have 34 students 1 assignment with 3 standards that's 34X3... that is a lot of grade entering for just one class.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1836,NA,"It does not hold kids accountable, places more unnecessary work on teachers, it does not reflect knowledge of content, kids have figured out the loop holes and won't do work and will just automatically seek the re take. And there is a SIGNIFCANTLY HUGE difference between a 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1837,NA,None.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1838,NA,It definitely DOES NOT WORK FOR AVID
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1839,NA,"Do not rely entirely on SLOs for grades. While homework assignments should not count as a major portion of the grade, there should still be a degree of accountability for students to submit their homework."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1840,NA,"On days where we have no SLOs, students lack motivation to participate in ""practice"" activities and work."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1841,NA,"SBG sometimes works with major skills that I want students to focus on. While students know what skills they need to practice, they often choose not to practice when given time in class, and then do not understand why they receive the grades they do on SLOs."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1842,NA,I personally have not had any issues with making the gradebook work with our SBG practices.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1843,NA,"SBG as we use it at CV would be great for AP classes, so long as teachers have the authority to remove students from the course who are not participating at an advanced level. In general education courses, students often choose to do whichever work is most likely to yield them a high grade, allowing all other work to fall to the side. This then begins to undermine classroom management strategies which rely on keeping students busy with engaging activities. When students know activities are not for a grade, they often refuse to give these activities a chance."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1844,NA,"SBG can allow advanced students to focus on the skills and standards they struggle in at their own pace. In many ways, students are allowed (and expected) to hold a certain degree of agency in maintaining high grades. This also means that the responsibility and choice falls more heavily on students than teachers, which also undermines a teacher's authority to make students get their work done."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1845,NA,Some classes lack state standards. Some classes would operate more effectively with traditional grading practices.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1846,NA,have better training for teachers
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1847,NA,It works for teachers that know how to use it
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1848,NA,"It doesnt work because the standards are messed up, always disappear, or do something weird constantly. Only one standard can be added to an assignment. Departments that dont know how to use are trying to load standards"
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1849,NA,Teachers arent trained or ready to use it.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1850,NA,"It allows students to show progress, rather than getting stuck with a grade."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1851,NA,"Not doing so continues the confusion students and parents have, as well as teachers doing whatever they want with the grades without accountability."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1852,NA,It does what it needs to do
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1853,NA,SBG teaches to standards and eliminates learning in the long run.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1856,NA,It is not intended for every class content. It is also intended to only help a group of students. Not everyone. It is not inclusive.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1857,NA,"It should be a team (department) decision, as it does not benefit every  content area."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1858,NA,So many of my standards are built upon prior knowledge. It’s difficult to give one grade for a standard.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1859,NA,In-N-Out off grades is easy once the classroom is set up.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1874,NA,For the language dept. our SLO's measure different topics and they all fall under one umbrella standard. We can not have these as CFA's and then measure for one big SLO that will cover all the different grammar topics....it is way too much for students learning a second language and even worse for IEP students. One of my team members has 32 IEP students.. impossible to do it this way.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1875,NA,The whole issues of the last grade being the one calculated for the standard grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1876,NA,Way too flexible. Synergy does not work well with it. It takes the last grade in order to calculate the standard grade. Students do not see movement in their grade.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1877,NA,none
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1878,NA,In Spanish it does not work the way it is set up. Needs to be looked at so that it can work if it is to continue to be mandated. SBG does not prepare students for Community colleges and universities. You can not turn in late assignments without penalties (if that). You do not do the work it is a 0. Period. Professors and Instructors do not have time to be waiting and accepting late work.

AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1886,NA,"SBG has reduced the success of students and does not prepare the students for the college environment or the rigors of technical certifications and careers.  SBG has made success harder for both the student and the teacher.  The majority of the students no longer prepare for tests, no longer do daily classwork, and no longer do daily homework - because they have learned that they can take and retake tests over and over and over again throughout the semester.  Students have learned to ignore all assignments that are not graded - which means they do not do the in class work nor the homework because with SBG students have learned that these items do not impact their ongoing grade.  This makes it difficult for teachers because all of these students then trying to do all of the retakes at the end of the semester because they have learned that they can continually fail tests (or answer just 1 question correctly and get a D) and they will still have a chance to redo it during the last couple of weeks of the semester.  So teachers are extremely overwhelmed with doing the regular teaching for students, then doing all of the reteaching sessions for all the students that decided to not study throughout the entire semester - because they have learned that with SBG they can simply make the teacher do multiple reteach sessions and multiple retakes.   Students that were honor roll students are now barely getting a D or C grade because they have no incentive to do their ongoing work throughout the semester because they are allowed to put it off due to SBG protocol.   This whole situation negatively impacts those students that are working hard throughout the semester because most of the free time during and especially at the end of the semester is spent doing reteaching and retakes for the students that have decided not to study or work throughout the semester.  Students that have kept up all semester and are working hard to improve their grades from a C to a B, or a B to an A are not getting the assistance they need to reach their academic goals because the amount of time spent on students that have refused to do their work throughout the semester.  Students have learned that under SBG, teachers must give them a D grade if they answer just 1 test question correctly.   For example, students are smart and they openly talk about this and they game the SBG system by answering just one or 2 questions correctly - it can be a 25 or 50 question test but they know that if they do not study, they will likely still be able to answer 1 question correctly even if they guess.  This SBG protocol allows them to do this, and they get a D grade which makes them completely eligible for all extracurricular activities and sports.  Teachers commonly see this happening. Teachers are required to give a D grade for answering 1 question correctly.  In college or technical certifications for trade careers do not follow this type of process, so this does not match what the students will face in real life."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1887,NA,"SBG grading protocol, with the continuous retakes does not help the students or teachers be successful."
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1888,NA,Currently there are too many steps to enter the columns for grading.  If a mistake is made (which can happen from time to time) there are to many steps to delete the error and sometimes an entire column of grades needs to be deleted before the gradebook will allow us to make the change needed.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1889,NA,Answered in first question above.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1890,NA,The students believe SBG is a benefit for them because they can go through nearly a whole semester without studying or doing the work because teachers are required to give continuous opportunity to do tests and projects without real deadlines.
AFDEA SBG Survey,doc1891,NA,A modified SBG program will still have no deadlines - allowing students to continue to wait until the last few weeks of the semester to really do their work.  The lack of deadlines that is part of SBG creates the situation where teachers are overwhelmed and burning out at the end of each semester because all the students are trying to now do the retakes for everything they took no initiative to do during the semester.  SBG has removed all student accountability and all deadlines and this does not match with real life in any successful company or trade or career.
